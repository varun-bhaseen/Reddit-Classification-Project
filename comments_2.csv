hey man  i m really not trying to edit war  it s just that this guy is constantly removing relevant information and talking to me through edits instead of my talk page  he seems to care more about the formatting than the actual info ,0
  more i can t make any real suggestions on improvement i wondered if the section statistics should be later on  or a subsection of types of accidents  i think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc  i can do that later on  if no one else does first if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know there appears to be a backlog on articles for review so i guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up  it s listed in the relevant form eg wikipedia good article nominations  trans port ,0

sorry if the word  nonsense  was offensive to you  anyway  i m not intending to write anything in the article wow they would jump on me for vandalism i m merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference  i have been to the selective breeding page but it s almost a stub  it points to  animal breeding  which is a short messy article that gives you no info  there must be someone around with expertise in eugenics ,0

before you start throwing accusations and warnings at me  lets review the edit itself making ad hominem attacks isn t going to strengthen your argument  it will merely make it look like you are abusing your power as an admin now  the edit itself is relevant this is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late  his absence is notable  since he is the only living ex president who did not attend  that s certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier i intend to revert this edit  in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself  and not throw accusations around quite so liberally  perhaps  if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this  we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully ,0

 re considering  st paragraph edit  i don t understand the reasons for  s recent edit of this article  not that i m sure that the data are necessarily wrong  rather  i m persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement  in support of my view that this edit should be reverted  i would invite anyone to re visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists a benjamin cardozo  a learned hand b john marshall harlan  b john marshall harlan ii  the question becomes  would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph i think not perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point  less humorous  but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale at a minimum  i m questioning this edit it deserves to be reconsidered  ,0

 not at all  you are making a straw man argument here  i never claimed o donohue had that position  rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the dsm position  which is exactly what the quote says and also something o donohue agrees with  again  i was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a  sex  orientation  since many researchers hold this position  it would be unfair to call it absurd  the disorder part is divided in the field  some argue that it is not a disorder at all  some do  at the end of the day  it is a value judgment  as cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement  if we choose to make this value judgment in the article  it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis  ,0
 mainland asia includes the lower basin of china s yangtze river as well as korea but being specific is fine too i just found a citation for a more comprehensive dna study by hammer below  rather than our generarizations and speculation so far  citation for yayoi culture was brought to japan by migrants from korea  who in turn trace their roots to southeast asia south china dna study by hammer  describes the yayoi migration from korea based on the o sry genes and other genes with close lineage  haplogroups o m and o m reiterates that the entire o haplogroup has been proposed to have a southeast asian origin  their definition of southeast asia includes southern china then hypothesizes that the dispersals of neolithic farmers from southeast asia also brought haplogroup o lineages to korea and eventually to japan  in the concluding paragraph  it states we propose that the yayoi y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern asia  perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region  hammer s dna study is based on a global sample consisted of males from asian populations  including six populations sampled from across the japanese archipelago  ,0

 jmabel  in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite third way rhetoric  fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right wing force as far as i m aware  owning numerous books on the subject  that is not the scholary consensus at all  the consensus  developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as roger griffin  hamish mcdonald  roger eatwell and zeev sternhell all recongise fascism as a third way as the references show the only dissenters i m aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible  this of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books  for example  even the foremost scholary expert on fascism  and a former member of both the communist party and then socialist party of italy  renzo de felice doesn t try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status  this is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on mussolini ,0
 bi  you said you wanted to talk  at the bottom of the lead section you have written its promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator  but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials regarding in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials that statement appears to come from ref on page the full quote is if the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payload  then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials  although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures  it then goes on to say as we shall see  presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastol tethers needed  the primary message we want to leave with the reader is we don t need magic materials like buckminster fuller carbon nanotubes to make the space tether facility for a hastol system  existing materials will do  so it would appear that you misread your reference the tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials  to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report states the fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept is technically feasible  we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic air breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting  spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth into earth orbit  for more than one hastol architecture concept  we have developed a design solution using existing  or near term technologies  we expect that a number of the other hastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies  the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of earth to orbit space access  regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  and a boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general  the non spinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts the full quote is hyperskyhook  in zubrin proposed the hypersonic skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers  since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu,0

 is it scientific to attribute an event a  to cause b  where cause b was deliberate designed  with some sort of intelligent intent  don t answer the questions beyond that well  the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged  there are several major fundamental problems here  first  you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth  natural science might look at a honeycomb  see it is built by bees  and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb  and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees  that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth  id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here  this is not science in any sense of the word  it is mythology  when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox  they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes  no evidence of paul and his ox remain  i mean  really  second  natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable  theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up  id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally  how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria  if you don t understand it  you can t do statistics on it  id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn t have a complete  detailed  natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well  it s so improbable for this to happen  that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science  you can assign probabilities to something you don t understand  id is just making up their numbers  finally  your example has a  b  where b was deliberate design  that s all well and good for a rigged example  except that with respect to life on earth  b is unknown  your a  b example might qualify as forensic science  if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart  you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart  the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart  you can probably figure that s what killed him  you don t have that with life on earth  you have one scenario  a and you have no other cases to observe or test  so  in that sense  a  b is not scientific if you ve never actually observed b btw  b is teh intelligent designer  which has never been observed so  in that sense  no  it isn t science  ,0

i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article  there s a problem either the history and characteristics should be expanded  of the list should be culled i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between  and others myself included we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples there we did trappist  abbey  and foreign foreign includes all non belgium examples this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia  not a list people can find lists anywhere  and the article should reference this also  the style statistics are bad when you say style statistics  it sounds like a prescription  not a description an encyclopedia should follow the latter  and if the former is used  a citation should follow and you ll not find a valid one for this style in it s country of origin ,0

 czech republic is in central europe  the state of this article is part of the reason why people are making such confusions  especially more ridiculous is that they you would replace the mention of north caucasus in favor of north slope of caucasus mountains which isnt even a geographical area other than denoting the mountains in that region  countries are located within continents  yet for some reason you refuse to allow this article to be denoted a continent  this single factor alone would have made a massive difference for readers  i m tired of arguing with people who are essentially wiki squatters refusing to nudge on a given article ,0

paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however  the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate  invertebrates  radiolarians  sponges  plants  pollen  foot prints  etc and multiple processes may include permineralization  recrystalization  carbonization  replacement  dissolving  diagenesis  etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue  however quick burial is not questioned the major question is  how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab  which of course implies that given the right conditions  vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood  but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet  how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with ,0

ahh  hello witzeman symbols m m characters greek cyrillic ipa  t d my famous article witze  happiness wikipedia the witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families  regardless of race  age  character or knowledge  the outside world knows little about these elusive characters  and the honour of the witzeman  for those who have ever been a witzeman  it has been said to have been a great honour  although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed  a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years  until they are called by former witzemans via dreams  associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman the present witzeman is an year old boy namely benjamin woods  who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this  awesome radiance in his top right bumcheek he has not told a great number of people his testimony  but has promised to do so in years to come  history the present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the witzeman in present years  because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour  to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time  the term  witzeman  is a compound word of the adjective witze and  man witze being an th century term for  a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence unfortuneatly  witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind  for unspeakable reasons  proper history as early as the th century  witzemen were considered outcasts  and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks  this led to the  st witzeman rebellion of when the current witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team  this rebellion further disgraced the witzeman  as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced  gaga  at a government meeting that year  the period from here to the early s was a dark time in the witzemans history  however good times were to come for the witzeman  many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the s  building up to a great moment in the history the great rebellion of this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons  wearing clown masks  but otherwise completely naked  this was thought to be an act of circambulation  however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour  were  mentally  spiritually  and emotionaly scarred for life this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability  suffering from trauma  it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman  in a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed  stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased  although this was a formal agreement  many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman  as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted ,0

 reply are you being facetious  if not  you would have relayed the same message to jza and mrsc as my words were no more stern than theres  if you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk  then i will only be too glad to provide  you also failed to provide diffs in your message to me  in regards to which words you re claiming are offesive  perhaps wp assume good faith the two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous wikipedia guidelines  wp harass is just one for example the removal of third party references from articles which don t suit their pov  without entering an edit summary  considered by wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of wp blank the violation of wp neo by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with  despite being made aware of the policy  despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term the same tag team practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on british culture and trad counties  not just against me  again  if you would like evidence just ask it would seem however  looking at the messages on your talkpage above  especially the lovely intertude under uk mediation section  that jza messaged you  somebody he seems very familiar with  in violation of wp canvas  specifically the section on wikipedia canvas campaigning may interest you  if you re going to be an admin  may i suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines i have referenced in this message  rather than accusing me  a user who is being cyberstalked  of personal attacks systematic bias is not acceptable  you re here to make sure that our policies are upheld not to chip in for the sake of a friend  thanks ,0

 socialistm there are two important features of smith s concept of the invisible hand first  smith was not advocating a social policy  that people should act in their own self interest but rather was describing an observed economic reality  that people do act in their own interest second  smith was not claiming that all self interest has beneficial effects on the community  he did not argue that self interest is always good  he merely argued against the view that self interest is necessarily bad  it is worth noting that  upon his death  smith left much of his personal wealth to charity good let s all make sure we put forth the idea that adam smith was a socialist that s the wikipedia way  ,0

 attributing and classifying of personalities invitation  your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well known ideological systems may raise here  i propose a quite liberal variant of it  where definition may not be connected with one certain word  necessity however to follow certain classifying remains  my initial ideas on this branch  the ones  concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period  some artists  writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists  this definition is not false  but some more concrete things should be added  some specifics of lithuania we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat  renaissance from later modernism  which is more known for us  cultural aspirations of the later nat  ren  may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of lithuania  but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage  and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  lithuanian  i mean  that such authors in as iurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context  but it also  and even more  is a representative of lithuanian culture  when in european or world wide context  a parallel  example may be taken from literature of india  poet  tagore  well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india  making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture  but in his own country  he was seen as a modernist too  who was changing traditional cultural forms  especially stagnated ones  this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n  ren  could be seen as modernists  which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones  in lithuanian context  they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context  but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture  iurlionis is the best example here in other way  the later lithuanian modernists  they depended mostly to later  generation  approximately from  th decade of the th century  concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose  looking generally  was  to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life  see the table below we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here  the problem is  that both movements collaborated  especially their political wings did  and interchange of ideas between them is well seen  so  many researchers don t pay attention to this difference  especially in the soviet period  when national ideas were officially forbidden  mixture in description of these movements was allowed  e  g  philosopher ram  nas bytautas  who clearly depends to the first generation  is often described as liberal  and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation  as idea of liberalism period and generation  artists  writers  philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period  the younger generation  approx painter and composer iurlionis  painter kazys imonis  poet and philosopher vilius storastas vyd  nas  dramatist sofija kymantait iurlionien poets adomas jak  tas  motiejus gustaitis  liudas gira  composer stasys imkus  philosopher ram  nas bytautas reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture  almost unknown before them  the period between wwi and wwii and post war years  poets v mykolaitis putinas  kazys binkis  writer ignas einius jurk  nas  artists  all  ars  group philosopher juozas girnius  modernists  introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life  central european modernism note  lists of personalities isn t complete here  nor it s made precisely by prominence jul utc ,0

homo sex s are intent on legitimizing their behavior  therefore  they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are  gay in this way  their way of life will be received as being not only harmless  but perfectly normal  as generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy  they increasingly develop a tolerance for homo sex ity  in this way  it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being  similar to a religion  race or nationality  lestrade,0

 link to sacramento i placed a wikipedia link in this article where the word sacramento appears another editor  who appears to be stalking me and is reverting everything that i do  claims that i am overlinking by doing this i have read the policy  and think i understand it  and i disagree with him the word sacramento was not linked anywhere else in this article before i made the link  and i think that my link provided good context for a reader who did not know walnut creek but thought that maybe they knew sacramento was there anything wrong with my link i would like someone objective to give their opinions ,0

 a totallydisputed notice would probably be appropriate  given the depth of disagreement that exists here  but i cannot understand why highlighting statements identified by some as dubious would constitute disfiguring the article slimvirgin has also used that wording recently  but i rather think that inaccurate and irrelevant information is more of a disfigurement than is a template notice to answer your second question  my side has brought forward a proposal  and the other side has not yet responded this is sadly consistent with recent patterns of delay  i ll make no comment on whether or not this is a deliberate strategy  ,0

 randroide answers to next step guys  i do not see you taking steps to wikipedia requests for mediation i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional net access  and following those steps could result in new  undesired  controversial truncation of words by the software  i do not want that happenning could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided thank you  randroide answers to new reference by burgas at last we agree on something  of course that the new section is a good idea  the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there  come on  boys  start writing that section  i do not want all the kudos for myself  the new proposed article is  by now  an effort made only by me  but remember  npov and sources  all the sources  just like me citing el pa  s in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the th bomb  cheers indeed  a good point  and all the remarks in cope too  and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo  i agree with you larean  what randroide omits to mention on the section about the th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so  the original version he created was entirely pov  as is much of the rest of the proposed article  also  all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers npov it is not  you are right  southofwatford  in your randroide omits  section if you have not subscription to el pa  s i am sorry but that  s your problem  my institutional access also has some advantages  like paid access to el pa  s and many  many other publications and books that  s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet acces  it  s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources do you see the truncation of words is offsett  i think  by better sources btw  if you write under a randroide answers section you are  invading my space  i do not mind  really  but you are doing it  risking new truncations on your messages  to avoid this  please write outside randroide answers sections if you think that the proposed article is pov  work in it to make it npov  the article is not mine i ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here  it s very short  the issue is not whether i subscribe to el pa  s  its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it  all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is  to my mind  completely unreasonable  all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  very funny  southofwatford  i am going to follow this joke of yours please propose also the deletion of all books as sources  because  did you know there is always someone without this or that book  delete all references to tv or radio stations  because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home  delete all the references in spanish  because  did you know there are users who know no spanish it  s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes  really  i had a good laugh user southofwatford  how strange that you should find it so funny  after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced  so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny  it s simply bizarre  equally  in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense  except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response ,0

  the organization of sub topics  culture is thrown way down towards the end  after economy and tourism  which is inappropriate  the information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography  which makes it not only uninteresting  but also repetitive  information is interspersed all through the sub sections  without regard to whether or not they fit there  eg  the geography section starts with the fact that up is the  th largest state  that is not strictly geography  and belongs in the introduction  climate belongs towards the latter part of the page  perhaps before toursim  regions and cities is not such an interesting combination  in any case  cities of uttar pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own  because  up has several interesting cities  and regions  each with specialities of its own  like the copperware of moradabad  ceramics of khurja and carpets of bhadohi in fact i remember there used to be such information in the article before  ,0
i don t know the answer to this  but  legally  how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizen s civil rights  i don t know if this is the section nelson was charged under in the federal case  but if anyone could explain this  i would appreciate it you can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified  that s really not my concern here  since it s a dead letter i m concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal if the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice  it s not the first time look at issei sagawa part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn t perfect  and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted  and that guilty people will be acquited  from time to time that s the price you pay for having a legal system  in the end someone has to make the decision  and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right i don t think it s going out on a limb to say that the sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief ,0
decesed group members i ve seen a few articles where band members have their name  sollowed by  deceased whats wrong witht that it s just a little extra information for people who do not already know this surely this is the main reason such the articles exist in the first place  or even why the whole wikipedia site exists what s so bad about adding this word after people s names if they are no longer with us it is factual  non opinionative and does not slate them in anyway ,0

 deletion of account ok blueboy  editing from l g ng l has been disabled by blueboy for the following reason s came back from hour block and picked it right back up again and judging by history  not likely to get it for this this is to call attention to a topic which was resolved before any of the matters were addressed there are moderators deleting wikipedia history items  and moderator borgqueen s edit of cuisine of hawaii was simply a provocation and nothing more i am a reknowned chef of pacific rim cuisine  and the cuisine of hawaii  and the cuisine of hawaii is not local plate lunch that is like saying the cuisine of mexico is frozen burritos  or that the cuisine of canada is starbucks pastries  or that the cuisine of america is mcdonald s  its slanderous  vicious  and spiteful the main point here is why did the admin in question delete the history and no  it is not resolved until that problem is addressed and i tried discussing it with that user directly and my account was locked  that user is not open for discussion or ddebate  that admin suffers the god complex  and lovcked me from even editing my own page  hence the reason i had to wait to be unbanned to post here  and i am not leving here to back and become corrupt admin fodder back aon the topic page until thius matter is resolved between borgqueen and myself as i i will not subjegate myself to any further discrimination  hazing  or personal vendettas not likely to get it eh buddy listen up  you will delete my user page and account from the wiki  grommet  you are not going to lock me and keep my name  content or profile i am out of this facade which is wikipedia for good delete it all  now  grommet ,0

 s rant  presently  we are witnessing  an open war against croatian dinaric culture croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being  in  service of conservative hdz party  croatian writer predrag raos  for instance  performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition  another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergovi refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda  all tokavian people and their culture are serbian however  croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian  dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture  for example  the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music  marko kraljevi is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovi s book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje also  the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  dubrovnik even now  a contemporary croatian writer  born in dubrovnik  stijepo mijovi ko  an tells us a story about his uncle  also from dubrovnik area  who could memorize numerous gusle songs  stijepo mijovi ko  an  gusle  glasnik  may p dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin  born kalafatovi a daughter of famous gusle player ante  although illiterate  she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs  some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry  not far from dubrovnik  another coastal city makarska was  also a bastion of croatian gusle music  actually  this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players  this mediterranean area  also gave birth to  andrija ka  i mio  i th century catholic priest who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond  to honour ka  i s work  ivan me  trovi the most famous croatian sculptor  built a sculpture in america showing ka  i in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument  in addition to ka  i makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music  according to dr  fra karlo juri  i who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banovi zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovi kudri and culminating with the most known mate banovi trli as for dalmatian women  they didn t play gusle  it s considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound  olinko delorko  the researcher of  dalmatian  folk poetry in the s  states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women  especially the ones from the island of hvar  the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition  english writer maude m  holbach  travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century  states in her book dalmatia  the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region  as for dinaric dances  which took place at markets and certain festivals  they  are very picturesque and interesting  and worth going a long way to see  being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe  p this admiration for dinaric folk music  particularly gusle  was seen in both dalmatian litteral and  hinterland matija murko  the researcher of this literary music forms had reported that during his trips  through dalmatia in the s  he saw a child  barely three years old playing gusle  eduard osrede  ki hrvatske narodne juna  ke pjesme eljezno be p now  lets  take a look at  the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations  hajduk  junak  gusar  alkar  uskok  sinjska alka  etc  what do they have in common  of course  their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region  having this in mind  one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost  extinct why do we have so few gusle players today is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock  n  roll  culture if so  why has tamburitza music of northern croatia  gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its  dinaric counterpart  gusle music  is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre,0

  the vote was on the campbell case but the primary reason was the russian treaties baldwin was careful to emphasise that the treaties were the substance of his objections  standfordham wrote to the king  on october i saw mr baldwin who  in reply to my question do you want to turn the government out said yes  but not on the campbell issue  but on the russian treaties which the country generally condemns  he sees no alternative to a dissolution  it has always been expected  some wished for it before now  though he is opposed to hastening the government s fall and it is true that only in the house of commons were baldwin s strictures based on the campbell case at newcastle on october he congratulated macdonald on the agreement  achieved at a conference in london  on the dawes plan for reparations  and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the labour party s subservience to its extremists  and tearing to pieces the russian agreement  but the final debate on october was a mean parliamentary occasion  two days before  in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet  the cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence  preferring to go out on the campbell case to a defeat on the russian treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence  middlemas and barnes  p ,0

  unfortunately  judging from previous warnings  some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are  pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for admin proceding  as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack  pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack  and it has  in fact  been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once frankly  if you are looking for personal attacks  try yourself for your agf violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals  or david gerard for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others  it s very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things if you want to start blocking for incivility  i might suggest removing david gerard for a while for his actions  or elonka for falsely claiming that i was using sockpuppets or that i was harassing her  or the sysop whose very talk page says he s going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page  rules should apply to everyone  and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions  ,0

has anyone ever considered including tag team edit warring as a  rr violation  when two people act in tandem  unintentionally or intentionally  to make the same revert four times  they may not technically violate the  rr rule  but they certainly do so in spirit this was the problem on both sides in the edit war on the canada page  and precisely what i wanted to avoid on the dominion page  would it not be easier to warn editors as you did here rather than shut down pages for weeks at a time as was done in the canada case  i m sure this would cure the escalation problem without blocking access to pages  any comments on this ,0

in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view  in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view  since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian  historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity  while theology makes no such claims  it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell  or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable  but as enns said  it is a fringe view in the academe  even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp  the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources  therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia  while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wp undue  this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong  wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view  of course  this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties  since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers  us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes  so  in a sense  scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions  only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism  they are free to do this  but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians ,0

  all of those statements need to be referenced leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information to point out one thing  i ll bring up consolidated appropriations act first  it has a number of tags on it  the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number to remove the flag second  the only reference link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that it appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link it s possible that some came from this as well  i can t tell i ll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic  so the article is riddled with grammatical errors  mostly incomplete sentences on creation  the opening read consolidated appropriations act h r is a bill passed to the th united states congress i ve never heard this usage  to rather than by  and assume it is incorrect  another editor changed it  the lead is also missing an important determiner in any case  you can take a look at vesey  ,0

 tim  firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline  and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour  yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in  there is clearly a massive diffence between  say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions  or between the chinese and u s  jurisdictions  since the legal and regulatory systems are very different  as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets  beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in  say  paris or toulouse  even though they are both in the same jurisdiction  i appreciate that the situation in the u s  is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions  even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though  to give an example  the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market  but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist  niche and focused on high tech  to give another example  in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn t have an office in london  even if it had offices in every other big city  in fact all of the very top tier uk firms  dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them  despite its size  have just one uk office  in london  although they have other offices overseas  saying that dla has has offices across the united states  egypt  south africa  kenya  thailand  china would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader  we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesary element of vagueness  imprecision and even original research  i do accept that dla  with offices  is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article  however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it  and should be included as much as possible  ,0

 nope  i didn t read the guide to appealing  didn t have time  the user in question is engaged in harassment  i ve been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it  he she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page  reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it  my second pass  couldn t even preview changes then changed his her mind as to my real wiki sin  since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on archive org was on him her not me and the usual span for pre bern had expired long ago decided my real sin was original research  oh noes and continued to revert based on that  does or add clutter  sure it can  but if the user in question was really concerned about that  about the quality of the article and about extraneous details  why didn t he she even notice two paragraphs already there  comprising about of the entire article  dealt with norman schwarzkopf  an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name  i ll tell you why  the user wasn t engaged in good faith goodwill editing and the normal back and forth that leads to better articles  he she was involved in blocking input to the article  why  was it personal against me  or was it to preserve the existing content of the article  including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand  i can only speculate  but i d guess it s some sort of power trip and wiki bullying  i don t really have time for this  i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn t directly related to content and improving articles  i could pretend this user didn t do what he she did  but i m wasting my own time here and i don t really have a stake in any such pretense  i don t have any stake in improving this article either  no dog in the race  i just see how it can be improved and made more informative  as a long term wikipedia user and editor  i don t see any problem in jumping in and fixing something  i almost expect some sort of pushback now  but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on target in very minor stub like articles  the problem isn t me here  it s that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior  and they are getting away with it  wikipedia becomes a much poorer place  a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share  also  i don t recal ever having called him her a bot  i think you put those words in my mouth  perhaps inadvertently  his her behavior is malicious  but probably not malware  just the normal human collection of problems  i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper  he she isn t quite qualified for that at this point anyway  and it s having a very chilling effect across wikipedia  i won t egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms  i will continue to write in english  and to read articles on wikipedia in english  and to think of ways to improve them in english  i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here  and most of the rest of the wikijargon  nothing new under the sun here  if you read the edits i made carefully  and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user  you will see i m not off the mark here at all  i know what s going on  i don t know why  but i don t have to  and i expect the motivations aren t interesting  respond if you have anything to say  ,0

summary of situation  user shimshem has taken a dislike to this article  and has tried numerous methods to either get it deleted or its name changed completely invalid speedy deletion request invalid drv request nominated for deletion via afd  despite the fact that it had passed an afd this year in fact the afd was withdrawn at for keep  the current afd here stands at for keep  but despite that  shimshem has wikilawyered all the way through it once it became clear that it was going to be kept  they decided a name change would be better changed the name of the band in the article  and was told to take it to talk  after a brief non discussion on talk  moved the article anyway  and was reverted  i was originally unsure of the motives of this editor why they were completely desperate to delete or move this article until i noted they were interested in tamil subjects  one of which is m i a artist and guessed that they believed that the two could be confused their subsequent creation of the article m i a as a redirect to m i a artist  proved this  as far as i am concerned  as to whether the band is actually called mia or m i a it differs the band itself uses m i a  as the heading on their own website  but then uses a combination of both elsewhere since in the case of most sources  this is only likely to be laziness  much as r e m  are regularly referred to as rem and since the article has existed here for a while  and that all the backlinks go to this version  and most of all because we shouldn t let disruptive users get their way  the article should stay here ,0

 meter  s sigh and my concerns  only because mr  meter  had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far i did not have a single chance to develop it  his article called falsetto is not about falsetto  it may be about his arrogance  who knows  there are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto  there are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which mr  meter  such anxiously protects  in england  italy or spain th century were described entirely different types of falsettos  on the top of it  mr  meter  perhaps never heard pavarotti singing falsetto  or the falsetto of ian gillan  singing of king diamond is based on falsetto  what about michael kiske  is it not falsetto  mariah carey or whitney houston do  did  not sing falsetto  does any of these falsettos sound breathy  not to me  isn t out there published a note about those  maybe only because  meter  does not look for it  why  it would not fit to his article  he would have to admit that his only source vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk meter  quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the world  the whole physiology of his only falsetto is based on encyclopedia  well  perhaps it is enough for wikipedia or himself  but not for me  no  there is much more out there only regarding physiology  much much more  and just because you allow idiot  s like  meter  to develop wikipedia  the people  the readers of wikipedia will read  shit where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at ies  mr know everything  feel free to block me again  i have no desire to write here any more ,0

 removed pov i removed undo criticism of secretary boutwell and pov  wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead  the following has been removed from the article  boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation  shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge  he believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception  henry adams wrote in a much quoted analysis in he believed in common schools  and not in political science  in ledgers and cash books  but not in adam smith or mill  as one might believe in the multiplication table  but not in laplace or newton  by a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice  and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions henry adams  the session  north american review  july p but in a very corrupt time  it spoke well of boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his cabinet post  either for himself or his friends  living within his salary  he lodged in a boarding house throughout his tenure  his only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker though never for money  chicago times  march he is an inaccessible man  uninfluenced by fear  favor  affection or hope of reward  and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred  a new england politician wrote his brother  henry f  french to benjamin b  french  march benjamin b  french papers  library of congress  boutwell s financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments  but while boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of washington  remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses  ,0

 question on possible citation i m sorry if i missed your question i don t pay much attention to that page  in response to your question  let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation  the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view i haven t yet worked in no original research wp nor says that we mustn t integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions  comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research  we can integrate information  so long as we don t arrive at new theories  another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy  the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate  getting down to details  the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source  the bauer site  even if somewhat unreliable  may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer  i m not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct  however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable  the sources are sufficient  and no original conclusions are made  the website takedown issue is confusing to me  but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources  overall  my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better  attack articles are not encouraged  while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldn t enlarge the warts  nor ignore their better features  balance is a part of npov but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources  there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war  it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer  it isn t clear if she did  and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known  it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs  i don t see how that can be objective  bauer  i m sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al but i ve been somewhat overloaded at work  personally  i think the article is better now than when i first saw it  thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn t seem like a lynch mob  y all are doing a good job  and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted i m glad to help and try and make the article neater  and i don t mean to sound brusque in the summary field  but there was a lot to cram in there  thanks for the note  i appreciate it  i would say karen saying i ve called her names is an out and out fabrication  i ve never done any such thing  or whether it s because he s been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia  repeatedly and without consequences i ve accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have  that isn t namecalling by a long stretch  i m really weary of these attacks over this  this is mob rule  while avi seems genuine  she s hanging with a tough insulting tribe  the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour  blaming me won t make my points any less valid  nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd  it s the internet equivalent of stoning  this is not a fabrication  i get awfully tired of being called a troll  or part of a mob or cult or group troll  or a self interested partisan  or a blog comment commando  or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself  you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy  fat and ugly  putting the word if in front of it doesn t make it any less of an insult  i ve tried to be polite to you  and will continue to do so  but this is the response  and  please notice  like abi  avi is avraham the admin  abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness  i counseled against piling on  talk contribs those are not ad hominem names karen  yet you ve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho  you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light  it s obvious you two are pro tnh and absolutewrite  that s self interest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling  well  avi can make her own decisons about it then can t sh,0

  that would be pretty odd for those declassified documents to mention a movie that was created after the events for which both the movie and the documents do related about  the declassified documents were not synthesized for the movie  unless you want to prove a conspiracy on the synthesis  very odd it is perfectly valid to use the documents to relate to the same historical events to further verify the what happened  but the use of primary source in such a was is not ideal for wikipedia  since it is not ideal  that is why i left it here on the talk page if someone wants to research it more to find ideal references  ,0

direct indirect relation is it correct to say that  technically  if a degree shot  by elevation  reaches the longest distance  then a degree will reach the same distance as a degree shot  if so  could the lower than shot be considered direct fire  and the higher than shot considered indirect fire  if so  i think this is a great explanation  or one way of viewing things  ,0

 i think the entire article should be tagged as politicized and the part about future trends as speculative my point was that scientists are learners  and we are increasingly using them as know it all teachers yes  they probably can make educated guesses better than anyone else  but its still an educated guess also  if you didn t notice  i am totally against spewing unnecessary carbon as this statement i think this article superbly misses the point that pollution and waste of all types are stupid ways to go about doing things where better ways are known  and we are making guinea pigs of all our planet s species points out  ,0

 philosopher rfc  philosopher  from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy i am going to make the case that we must call stefan molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers  in the lead this is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy  only that it is his career note  not all of the sources i use below are in the article at present  the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted  then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place  definitions  obviously  each source is going to use slightly different phrasing  some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent  using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political  ethical  and theistic specializations in one word  which we then elaborate on later in the article  philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his freedomain radio series libertarian libertarian thinker libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies anarcho capitalist anarcho capitalism is a political philosophy  voluntaryist voluntaryism  or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy  athiest arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches  ethics  ethics  sometimes known as philosophical ethics  ethical theory  moral theory  and moral philosophy  is a branch of philosophy secular ethics  secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy  primary source  as stefan molyneux is a living person  we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him  obviously  we don t want to host any sort of fringe claims if we are to dispute what he says about himself  though  then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this  or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place  i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct  he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media  which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the old school philosophers we re used to  freedomain radio about page my master s thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies i have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my mid teens  i left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at freedomain radio  i have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy  freedomain radio  the show that molyneux hosts  has the tagline the largest and most popular philosophical conversation in the world molyneux s books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy  particularly universally preferable behaviour  upb a rational proof of secular ethics and against the gods  a concise guide to atheism and agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies strong atheism  the case for evacuating the middle ground article  why i am a philosopher  video a response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy  an introduction to philosophy part video course produced by molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts  reality  knowledge  truth  gods religion  ethics  and politics unsolvable philosophical questions solved  video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable  proofs for god destroyed by a philosophical atheist video a philosophical review discusses the major philosophical  political  economic and social developments of video https w youtube com watch v udlsgjbw hs philosophy questio,0

request for help request for help hi again cat  as perviously i have noticed a strong anti greek bias on several articles related to macedonia  i ve had issues with both furper and beam  who seem to be admins that heavily favour fyrom  i ve officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block  edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious fyrom pov members of wikipedia  specifically balkanfever http en wikipedia org wiki wikipedia administrators noticeboard this anon apparently user crossthets c is an apparent pov pusher  c evidence below  as i said verbatim on politis talk page this is a difficult battle because so far i am alone at the moment  i am a newbie  and as i said to one of the admins on notice board  i feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman s ball however  i still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what i perceive as non npov behavior by these admins  i noticed while researching this issue you ve also have problems with them  would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so i can add them to my report to show i am not alone  furthermore  since you have been around longer you probably know more greeks than me around here  would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they ve also had problems with those two  and  if so  add those incidents to your list and perhaps get them to contact others where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking  the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously  i will check back here in a couple of days  have courage  regards ,0

 stradbroke galleon portuguese hallo moondyne  i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge  nazi s but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments  i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts  knowledge and information  the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about  discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland  the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here  there exists  in various libraries  books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain  the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions  what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group  i e  hesperian and his friends  who are representatives of the mainstream view  hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperian s mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperian s antagonistic attitude  simple  old fashioned professional jealousy  thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons  for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden  identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia  this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been  suck ed in by hesperian and his little band of mates  which is a pity  but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect wiki be any different  still it is dissapointing  happy trails  ,0

 reviewing blocks  you said i d also like to ask you that in future  for the sake of fairness and due process that you do not decline the unblock requests of users you block yourself unless the request is pure nonsense or abusive  from an ethical  reviews of blocks are meant to be carried out by a  rd party  will do i thought it was pretty clear in this case  given the editor s user page  gnaa  etc etc etc that the unblock request was pure nonsense also  i was under the impression that the unblock request would still be visible and reviewed by other admins i ll be more careful in the future  ,0

  i do not see any anti semitism here  if the guy gives lectures in new york synagogues and knocks down his country every single minute  using every opportunity in such influential newspapers as new york post  then one can state that his interests are not only personal  you can not find any intellectual person among neoconservatives in new york post  michelle malkin  andrea peyser  deborah orin  may her rest in peace  although i know she is rotting in hell and other essayists are the ones who make a great company for amir taheri  this guy has no mind at all  i agree that iran s regime is wrong  but the regime of shah that amir taheri is longing for  because he owned keyhan during that regime was not any better and islamic revolution was justified  look at how they intriduce amir taheri in both this article and in new york post  based in europe memeber of benador associates is europe that small  is that a small town  why don t they say based in the world journalist  or may be he is having a breakfast in london with christian amanpour and james rubin  eating lunch in jerusalem  and having some lectures and dinner with anti irani jew s in forest hills  new york in between emailing his full of hatred articles to new york post  isn t this stupid  how can you saysomebody is based in europe or asia or africa  ,0
 why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic ackoz suggests that  because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions  it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it i reject such a stance i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and or controversial where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedia s job is to report the truth this is wrong wikipedia s job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is any attempt to do that is original research instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability put a different way  wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion  not our opinions but those of reliable sources if the truth is clear and uncontroversial  it is easy for us to report that if the truth is murky and controversial  it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective  or pov  on the topic at hand i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides  obviously is  because some users  jadger and wikiferdi  don t want to discuss in fact  they want us to agree with their pov  that s not discussion about the npov edits  that s why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article  talk ,0

 regarding loyalmoonie and lgbt categories looked into it  and this editor seems to be pushing an anti lgbt agenda  they ve done similar stuff over at sailor moon  and made official looking warnings to other editors  this quote is bizarre  and is quite telling to insert those categories would ultimately give other people  who may not even support the lgbt movement  reading the article the assumption that every person who does enjoy sailor moon is a homo sex and or supports ssm i don t personally watch read sailor moon or know much about it  so i m not confident enough to re add the categories  but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless  and there is a sourced part in the article about female homo sex ity talk  ,0

 agreed  although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word  i was concentrating on the polish attitude here  as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand  obviously  if the article is to be written from a supra national perspective  at least the czech experience needs to be included  czechoslovakia  being the only functioning democracy in the region by the s  had closer ties with the west than poland did  and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than poland was  the west politically accepted the country s territorial mutilation  which was not the case with poland  that said  i am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as finland  the baltics  yugoslavia  or even ukraine  which had never been independent in the first place  is a good idea  while the west could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war  i think that the article s focus should be on poland and czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue  after all  there were dissidents in germany and the soviet union  too  who were harbouring grudges towards western politicians because of their appeasement policy oct utc ,0

 the spelling tacarimba la tumba del fuego santa maliga sacategas lo onto del sol y cruz is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of side by side by sondheim  available for rental only this version of the song  however  misspells llanfair pg  presumably to approximate the pronunciation and has the lyric  today s the last i ll be spreading rather than spending it would seem  therefore  that this source cannot be considered canonical  this rendering of the place name does accord with millicent martin s recording on the side by side by sondheim cast album  however the published version of the song  as contained in the hansen treasury of stephen sondheim songs  charles hansen music books has the lyric printed as tacarembo la tumbe del fuego santa malipas zacatecas la junta del sol y cruz and  being a printed source  as opposed to handwritten  as is the vocal score can presumably be considered definitive  linda lavin s pronunciation on the original cast recording of the mad show  for which the song was written  follows this spelling  which would suggest that the printed version is correct as it is a fictional place name  however  any discussion of correct spelling pronunciation is an academic one  at best  ,0

 speedy deletion of phi rho eta  a tag has been placed on phi rho eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia  this has been done under section g of the criteria for speedy deletion  because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement  for legal reasons  we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material  and as a consequence  your addition will most likely be deleted  you may use external websites as a source of information  but not as a source of sentences  this part is crucial  say it in your own words if the external website belongs to you  and you want to allow wikipedia to use the text which means allowing other people to modify it then you must include on the external site the statement i name am the author of this article article name and i release its content under the terms of the gnu free documentation license  version and later  you might want to look at wikipedia s policies and guidelines for more details  or ask a question here  if you think that this notice was placed here in error  you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article  just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the article s talk page explaining your position  but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion  if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay  please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself  but don t hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedia s policies and guidelines  ,0

 i think clockback that your suggested reference to ainsworth s involvement in the img is too long and that something along the lines of brief flirtation would be better  i think that the img reference needs to be short somewhere in the early career section posted after the article has been expanded a little  otherwise the article might appear weighty  i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth but bedsides  this brief dalliance with marxism  in an overall consideration of his political career  pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources  this is simply not reflected at all in the ainsworth article  i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister  who considered at least three other candidates before appointing ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by off riorob above  even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in ainsworth s biography  perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found which i suspect should not be difficult that it can be re included  i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against ainsworth  but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end  and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment actually it reflects worse on brown and the farcical reshuffle  ,0

  my experiences came up on the talk page but once i understood wikipedia i didn t post anything on the article related to my personal experiences  that was like the  nd day almost two months ago all of my references are verifiable there s nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation i didn t put my experiences in the judge edward nottingham article either although he was my judge i went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue  for instance  i wrote to the aba and asked for their input  and in fact  asked them to work on the article  i also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses  citing references from a lawyers point of view those references were deleted by someone  i can t remember who and don t know why  at this point  the only reference that i posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a  trans cript quoting a former federal judge and i know for sure that is a valid  trans cript the guy who runs the blog is a  rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers  even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration i had references for  i read in the wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts i don t believe that i did any original research  all i did is search the internet for references for the article i really didn t know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before i started working on this article  i had already been thinking about forms based filing but i started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ecf  which date back to also  when i was younger i worked as a systems analyst i did get the info on the laws and liberties of ma years ago  but wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway same as the u n  covenantcan t really hide that  i didn t add a and b together to prove a point  at least not consciously  like today  i was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the  th circuit had a more pro se friendly tone  which i think is because of judge learned hand  who was in the fifth circuit  and the only reason i know about that is that one time i went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the s because i was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se  no  there was not what i found in the s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but judge learned hand seemed pro se friendly i believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing i do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business  i ve been an entrepreneur  i didn t know about the federal judicial center until i started working on this article  that book on appellate procedure i found looking for references for this article  the manual on complex litigation i found looking for references for this article arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself one thing i started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation  i ordered the book slave nation at the library but i haven t got it yet  but now when i look at pro se law in the different states i think free state  slave state  border state  also  there were issues related to indians in some of the western states  the labor union movement had a lot to do with it too  i think  so did the history of workmen s comp  which is of course related to unions  ,0

  when i looked at the cato edit  it was simply a removal of the reference  the addition of another donor  and a change in the language  without an edit summary to explain  the changes were unjustified your clarification certainly helps thanks  also  for adding the reference on summers  frankly  i did not look at the sources removed or added  my main concern was the unexplained edits  summaries are important  and then i saw that the messages about these same concerns from a while back  so my message is more of a reminder  most importantly  you are incorrect if you think it is not against the rules to add unsourced material one of the core content policies is wp v  and wp rs allows us to carry out that policy  happy editing  ,0

 i ve been though the article  it s simply untrue that only men are consistently referred to a jew s but womabn and children are not  many passages refer generally to jew s clearly meaning men  woman and children  only one sentence corresponds to your criticism the screening of the population  however resulted in jew s jew ish women and jew ish children  of which jew s and jew ish women were shot in co operation with the security service  this particular sentence should be rewritten  i ll just do it  but the sentence itself is grammatically confusing  so whoever wrote it may wish to check that i understood it correctly  ,0

referring to her as  catherine  i was told in no uncertain terms that i could not refer to anyone  living or dead  by their  st names on wp if a female had a title  she had to be referred to as that throughout her article ie lady amy  or  lady dudley  for amy robsart  even though  lady amy  was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight had no title wrong after northumberland was attainted all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl a duke she did not become  lady dudley  until elizabeth i knighted robert dudley near the end of amy s life nor was she then  lady amy dudley  as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl duke i thought it was simpler to refer to her as just  amy  throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name styles  but was told it was against wp  rules though i wasn t pointed to a link for it noblewomen are usually called by their  st names round here as far as i can see  even when they have surnames are not  of  something mary boleyn is called  mary not  lady carey  or  lady stafford catherine neville is called  catherine not  the duchess of norfolk etc they re not royals  as for males  i was told they had to be referred to by their title ie leicester or last name ie dudley i was banging head on keyboard going  but no one just says  the king  all the time or refers to them as  plantagenet  or keeps changing their titles ie  henry of bolingbroke going from earl of derby to duke of hereford to duke of lancaster to king of england so how does kate get to be consistently referred to as  catherine  throughout the article  without her title appended i ve only been here a few months i would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me  as my main interest is british history i am quite confused ,0

they are all  cunt s it s not worth editing articles here concerning any serious issue  all sides consist of either people employed to edit or people with very strong opinions that will never  ever change  they advocate their stance as something that is interesting to them instead of using the encyclopedia as a book of knowledge and contributing what they are sure to know soon with the centralization of the net into larger and larger sites  independent information in general will be extinguished  wikipedia  a project that started by nerds and professionals within their set fields will become the altar of knowledge where depth and true insight is sacrificed for becoming the sound magnifier of yellow press and popular science  the new tool that is intended to auto  trans late articles from one wikipedia to an other will extinguish the few national wikipedias that through their niche provide those of multilingual capacity an ability to cross check facts through other perspectives  with few small  independent sites left  with no or few free university pages left  real knowledge will be the privilege of the few that know how to use academic search engines and have the money to pay for them ,0

  excellent  and please don t damage your book on our account  for sure  it is an interesting question  where was the camera  that s a fair question  to jump to the conclusion that it was impossible is ludicrous  but that s typical for the moonbats  the picture is useful for another reason  as it shows a similar relative position of the lem and the antenna for this apollo flight as on that web page that argues about those objects in apollo in both cases  the antenna is at a degree angle away from the lem  and both the near photo and the distant photo on that website are consistent with each other  despite the website s claims to the contrary  the moonbats isolate on specific items as their evidence but the more one sees the broader picture  the more their phony arguments get shown up  ,0

dect isn t really a new technology  it s a newer standard  but tdm tdma fdma digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of dect  dect is itself a successor to ct japan s phs is very similar  and  of course  gsm  d amps  and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half  to suggest there are special health issues with dect would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject  dect is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces  both during  trans missions  and inherently because even when in use the td nature of the system means the system isn t  trans mitting continuously as i believe i ve said before  there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of low power radio technology  and there being a link in the see also  section of this article to it  that article  of course  should look nothing like the section i yanked  there is nothing about dect however that merits a special section on dect s dangers  especially when new technology or otherwise there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue ,0

 rajputs  not rajasthanis right p prof  hancock s studies mention that the romani people are most closely related to the punjabis and rajputs  i m pretty sure not rajasthanis  he calls proto romani rajputic  the distinction is important  if they are partly descended from rajputs  who were never really confined to any one part of india  that would explain the linguistic variation within the indic words in romani  for example  why the use of  o instead of  aa at the end of masculine nouns adjectives in romani  this is certainly a characteristic of gujarati and sindhi  but is it a characteristic of rajasthani languages  anyway  if i m wrong in making the last change i made as of now  i ll be happy to revert it myself oh  of course  ,0

 words of encouragement to user damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propaganda damemk  you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia  user laveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia  macedonian nation history language culture sports and what else not  he is spending a lot of time working on his cause  pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia  how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipedia wikiproject romacedonia where he has listed himself as a member  so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia  and the great damage done by user laveol and other users with the bulgarian and anti macedonian propaganda  hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction  removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles  cleaning them of false fabricated information  and giving the facts to the world  and the views of the macedonian science and sources  i don t have much time now  but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period  i am open to any collaboration effort for the above goals i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia  simply because he is able to  and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda  ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia  macedonian nation history lanugage culture sports damemk  i hope you write something here  at least to show that user talk damemk and user talk ejanev is not the same user  some insight into my user name ejanev the only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is ejanev it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev user damemk is a separate user  probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name  and mk or the code of republic of macedonia it does happen that i am from canada  i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years and yes  having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the th century and having it into st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all it s attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia  i am not the only user editor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda  that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles  you can watch the contributions of special contributions laveol and see that more than of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes  ,0

 on mohammed al bayati s qualifications with regards to the edits over the past day  i think that while mohammed al bayati s qualifications are tangentially relevant  the purpose of the text as they are placed right now is to prove that mohammed al bayati is not qualified to review the autopsy report  this i think violates npov  if the qualifications are to be included they should come under the criticism and controversy section  quoted by whoever it is that accused mohammed al bayati  of not being qualified to review the autopsy report is cited  if nobody made the accusations  then this is original synthesis  and should again be removed  ,0

 mediation hello  i am atyndall and i have volunteered to take on your mediation case  during this discussion i will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute  after having a look at the discussion above  this is what i have found  quizzicalbee has been adding the sentence according to chesler  the the u s  embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a u s  citizen hurmata has been reverting this back to she reports that the u s  embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country  hurmata objects to quizzicalbee s sentence as he she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source  qb objects  saying that maybe in the s us citizenship could have been revoked by the us afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false  hurmata countered that the citation threat qb was referring to is not the one that was cited  qb states that there is no evidence disproving her claims  so they are valid  could the involved users please place below to verify that this statement is correct or suggest why it is not correct  thankyou  talk ,0
well  arthur  i have printed the paper  and the condition is in fact what ultra power says it is  not your correction  it seems that the paper is not incorrect  but rather correct and pointless you have already identified the worst problem  the third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values  however  this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a e  so let s do that we want a function f satisfying f e and f n exp f n defined as widely as possible  we observe that n and n present no problems  f and f to extend f to all positive real numbers  it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length such as and we want f to be continuously differentiable the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on or equivalently on this is obviously whacky  but we needn t worry about this because a e  next  for no obvious  or explained  reason we require that f is monotone on the interval from the functional equation f x ln f x we get f x f x f x hence f f f f so f must be constant on not too surprisingly  the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way  f x exp x  exp x  x thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between and ,0

lol  you know what i meant  whichever president came before hafez  i just new he was president before assad  has considerable foreground of support  in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup  they would have claimed instability would arise  as assad s supporters are trying to use in their defense  what i am trying to say is that although bashar assad had good economic and international policies for syria  you should not fear a non baathist potentially being elected syria s economic and international policies won t change  iran would still be a major factor in syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges the only this that would change are social freedoms  and for the better  also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today  the muslim brotherhood in syria is weak  even weaker than the islamist prescence in libya  the rebels in libya had support  as we see now  and yet could hardly take control without nato  what chance does the syrian muslim brotherhood have  none  if anything  nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the muslim brotherhood  making them less of an influence in the everyday life of syrians  as you know i am pro syria and armenia  just not pro assad  unlike armenia where people like sargsyan and kopcharyan were democratically elected  assad was not  no one ran against him because they were not allowed  ,0

 unblock i ll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks  but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage  as you might well imagine why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal  that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone who s editing with an account over someone who s editing without one  especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ip editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing for exampleand this is  yep  maybe you guessed it  question why is it supposedly okay according to you  for someone with a name  like  say  escape orbit  to dish out a personal attack  but not for me to give him one back because i m just a lowly ip editor  specifically  why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one  ebay  in the lead  is because i wanted it in there  even though that is a total lie  but it s supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid here s another one  why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred  but then when i say their reversions are vandalism  i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because i m an ip only editor ready for one more  then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ip editors a warning template  but when i  as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially smiley girl  i get dinged with oh  you can t do that  cause that s a  personal attack or oh  that s bad because that s  harassment oh yeah  here s one more  remember the rule about edit warring  just in general  meaning that it doesn t even have to be breaking  rr  that says that but i was right  so i was not edit warring  is no defense well then doesn t that apply to meeting some so called consensus too  since some things aren t cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so called consensus wanted the thing to say well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive  partial consensus wants it to say  and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees  you ignore that above mentioned edit warring rule and give her him a pass anyway  but when i  an ip only editor who s against your exclusive consensus  do the same thing  it s edit warring even though it was the same thing as what smiley s doing  remember the being right matching consensus is no defense rule ,0

 trying to measure the number of cafes this is one of those places where i am so frustrated by wikipedia s ban on original research  the article has the absurdly low at least six cafes on the ave or its alleys i don t know where that number comes from  nor what they consider a cafe but it seems to me that well within any reasonable definition  the scene includes solstice  cafe zoe  the original allegro  on an alley parallel to the ave arguably  its second location in the college inn also counts  the ugly mug  half block off the cafe at the corner of nd that used to be the roma  but i can t recall its new name  sureshot  the continental  caffe apassionato  wow bubble tea  shinka tea company  yunnie bubble tea  pochi tea  gingko tea house  tully s starbucks  wannabee  one block off still life on the ave  at the grand illusion technically  the entrance is around the corner  but it is clearly effectively on the ave this doesn t even count hangouts that are mainly bars or restaurants or takeout food joints  nor does it count things like u  bookstore and bulldog news  both of which have busy espresso operations  nor does it count ice cream stands  and i m sure i m missing something  this is all just offhand talk  ,0
actually  undue weight can also results in zero weight as it is the whole issue is insinuation and extrapolation of given events just because the article doesn t outright say that edwards is the father because there was no father listed  it is quite clear that this is the intent now  editors familiar with me consider me to be a fnc fanboy and appolgist regarding conservatives and republicans  so my objection to this is clearly not a partisan point of view that said this is in violation of several wp policies ,0

  your suggestion of editing the article is completely workable and was working as per wikipedia guidelines until jayjg and slimvirgin started deleting large relevant chunks of the article  and reverting it to what we have now  as punitive gestures if we can all agree to concentrate on making the article better  instead of punishing each other  there is no reason the article has to be locked  i agree that we should start with an extremely innocuous definition preamble statement we can all agree on however  a definition doesn t do anyone any good unless it conveys some sort of information if there were just one word that we could all agree is associated with terrorism  that would be better than no definition at all intimidate for instance  ,0

 just to add kansas bear when i said you made the elementry mistake of calling it a treaty when it was in fact a congrass is because as you left out as usual my post in which you regarded the three deligations as having been pressent at the treaty o arass with papal meditiation the treaty of arass was a private treaty only between the deligations of burgundy and france and made a military alliance in again we are debatting on the burgundian recognition stop changing the subject you clearly are giving fallactious statements and i feel your posts are utterly questionable if you happend to remeber a month ago we both agreed the congrass and treaty of arass were different i corrected your statement when you regarded the three deligations as bieng pressent at the treaty of arass p s stop with your childish personal attacks i aqsked you to give sources regarding that burgundy didnt recognize henry as king of france but you give refs regarding the treaty of arass and mixing up the posts if you cant handle the fact that burgundy recognised henry as king of france then i have already reverted you on the dual monarchy article you should be ashamed of your fallactious remarks nd utterly questionable unsourced facts ,0

 rather crude ancestor of the vaccine  the source is a biography of louis xvi louis xvi le roi bienfaisant jean de viguerie  on the various  and often contradictory  influences of the french government prior to the revolution where a section is devoted to the innoculation of the royal family  and makes note of how the intendant of franche comte had financed physicians to do it through his province  and how it was later used by washington on his continental army  the truth he actually died on december it even says so in a book that i have  facts about george washington george washington owned over acres of land washington lived in new york and phildelphia during his preidency the preceding unsigned comment was added by ga in zh wikipedia please add link ga zh in interwiki section  thanks  ,0

 bloc voting countries with large populations of non nationals may have their televote influenced considerably  this has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the balkan countries of the former yugoslavia this is full blown crazy  what does non nationals mean  these countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages  the stars in croatia are popular in serbia and vice versa  people are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries  there are some refugees in each of those countries  but that doesn t really explain why croatia would always give the highest no of pts to serbia  or macedonia to serbia  where there was no conflict to speak of for example  i m a bosnian serb and me voting for a croatian or a serbian song is not unusual  but i m not a bosnian non national  i have the passport of bih  and my family has never lived in serbia in history  it s really about mutual intelligibility  which is why scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time  it s the language and sensibility  ,0

perhaps overlooked in the discussion of steve moore s credentials is another aspect of the newsweek article  by saying that knox s supporters have hurt her by expressing their opinions  nadeau has effectively stated that the decisions of the italian court will be  or have been  influenced by anger and anti american sentiment rather than the evidence alone  i don t know if nadeau s experience in italy qualifies her to make such an assessment  but taking her as a rs to make that statement would be as great an insult to italian jurisprudence as anything knox s supporters have said  i wholly concur with pablo s opinion that the piece has no place in the article ,0

 i was trying to inject some humour  as evidenced by my winky face  in this ridiculous  overblown  and unnecessarily dramatic situation  if you took the time to familiarize yourself with the situation  you would see that the person i insulted was attacking my cited and factual contributions by actively censoring them no explanation  which i retaliated with by insulting him  i thought that his conduct was insult worthy at the time  as would any sane individual who was not familiar with wikipedia s no insult rule  however i have since realized that what i did was wrong because this site does not allow for harsh words  which is why i will not use them again even if they are used against me  which they were during this ordeal wikipedia is the place for me because my edit was constructive and brought a greater knowledge to the subject s topic  but  the fact that i insulted another user in the edit summary is regrettable  and i know that now if you seriously think the edit linked above constitutes a better insult ,0

 you are totally wrong the synonyms or terms of kshatriya and andhra kshatriya was and is used for only rajus but not other castes of andhra pradesh acording to anthropological survey of india by kumar suresh singh which can be seen above and also in his other books because rajus are kshatriyas and also called as rachavaru in telugu in medeival period thats why krishna rao used the word rachavaru and also he is not an ordinary man b v krishna rao belongs to andhra historical research society according to kumar suresh singh they are kshatriyas who migrated from north india but not locals which is also supported by other anthropologers as the truth  is aryans initially entered into indian  sub continent and stayed in north india north east and then their castes i e  brahmins kshatriyas vaishyas gradully migrated and settled to south india  no  ,0

thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously to reiterate my original explanatoin to james  i m interested in this more on a meta level  how do we approach controversial subjects  than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards moore and his film  that is  i m trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view  any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is  in itself  an editorial statment seems wrong  such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article see  for example  something like roe v  wade  there s no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case even if you really consider moore s movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda  and to risk the wiki equivalent of godwin s law here note that the article on triumph of the will doesn t feel the need to explain all the reasons why  nazi  germany wasn t all it was cracked up to be  similarly  shouldn t we just describe the content of the movie  noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the bin laden family departure or w hate ver we can put the facts about that subject there jul utc ,0

 if you re offended by the birther analogy  consider the analogy of including a title like dark moon  apollo and the whistle blowers by bill kaysing in the see also section for neil armstrong or buzz aldrin fortunately  this book doesn t have it s own article yet  but it stands at in amazon s best seller list  compared to montford s obviously the moon landing hoax conspiracy theory is quite a bit more obvious as a piece of fringe nonsense and yet it s sales figures would indicate that it s being taken seriously by many  all except nasa s partisans  namely  almost everybody  ,0

 frederic bourdin  hey jimbo  your b did not step back  instead he asked a friend admin  calling him to help him with this matter against me you have a open door policy right and when i came nicely explaining what the problem was and that i would be very happy to end it even though i did not feel it was fair it seemed to me that you really wanted to help  but i got  block  again and again for nothing  let say i m not very happy about that because it s obvious to me that the bad guys are winning  you know i can t be  block  for long though since i m a pretty good brain with computers  that s not why i m mad  i m mad because you lied to me  all the people involved against me here are biaised so of cpurse unfair  and i won t let it go and no matter what i will have to do i shall do it  your actions have been unfair and unwarranted  and even the great jimbo is not going to stand up for some fairness  we ll see then  good night ,0

 this is untrue i have not been  block  for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons  since the reasons mentioned are not actually true it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons  including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum  and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude  the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude  the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts  and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user  antagonizing me usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page  show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person  and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing  the second claim is physically possible  but is blatantly false i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner  as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations  for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him  and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently having other users delete my comments  participate in blatant fradulent  ism  post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me  etc is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate  when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate  in addition  if i wish for other users to not communicate with me  i also have that right  it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex spouses from communicating with each other when necessary  the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet  it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and or post contact information etc that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere  so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim  refusal to abide by the site s guidelines is impossible since guidelines and rules are two different thing wikipedia does not have any rules and all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues  even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and or conventions and or etc so that is also impossible  ,0

as you kinow it yourself you are not elligible nor credible nor a reliable source of neutrality in this case as you are yourself a mormon and all you do is to support other mormons  without following any wikipedias rules  but your own churchs solidarity  i dont believe that any of you has even the intention of being straightfo rward with non mormon or to be a little bit honest  but that the alone thing that activate you is your own religious believe and the pedantisme to think that all you may say or do is auto righteous in the name of the church and all the illusions you dream of with open eyes  i dont want a mormon admi i dont want a mmormon admi i dont want a mormon admi to look into this case but an exterm  n al one with no relations nor conacts what so ever with this church nor its representants or members  if you cant do that  must be because your circle of admi friends is around the church  or because you know very deeply that all you did was deeply unappropriate and wont stand a micro mile in a wiki trail i am mad  very mad at you  also because you ignore what i have say  so why should i care about your saying and doing if we have to be neutraly equal  any idea  i want the text who was deleeted from the archive  it is unacceptable that a text is deleeted from archive and from the edit history  just one hour after it was reverted and less than a day after it was written  without any previous warning of any kind about it  this is all about wiki rules and you have broken them all ,0

  july utc  well  yes  that s fine  but the point here is that there is no publisher s statement made about anything in that sentence  the idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference  if the resource says  joe at worms then we write joe ate worms about tarnishing any reputation  that isn t the point at all  and about accepted practices in the publishing world  this is wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call policy and guidelines since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus  about people keeping records of how many books were published  i think you missed the point there  publisher s weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example  they are a secondary source  do you see how that s different about the article on fip  it hadn t any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted  the only references which it had on the bottom were see also references that pointed to this article here  and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here  fip and acim org are the same entity  facim is also the same entity  this is known  having the same board of directors  as well as sharing the same registered trademark acim etc makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources ,0

 issues onefortyone  the reason why i removed your edits  because they have following problems it is graceland that is  nd most visited place in the usa not biltmore estate  the d  cor throughout the house has often been criticized is incorrect  it has not been criticized by anyone  then you put up the quotes of albert goldman  a fringe theorist on elvis presley  and added them under graceland basement  which is irrelevant  those conflicting reports about his death have no relevance on this article  especially when they are disputed or rejected enough times this is why this kind of content misleads and should be removed  i don t see any consensus for adding it on archives or previous discussion either  ,0

the multitude of sources simply cannot be ignored  there are several articles stating the environmental impact  i will actually expand the section in the article because the monument is so big  people should know as a part of an encyclopedia the river bed violations  i would disagree with the arguments given above and that the edit should have more expansion within the article as a half dozen citations stating there are environmental issues  also there is a persistent  conflict of interest from the users above but from their follow ups  there intentions will be clear ,0

 can someone explain criticism to me this is taken from the criticisms section of the article since logic is inherently constant  and that some things are more true than others  it means that strong relativism cannot hold true under many conditions  relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another  an example of a similar phenomenon is the  gay  marriage debate in the u s an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn t apply to them  as they do not weigh up the effects of their views  can someone explain what exactly this means i do not follow the first half of the paragraph  the one that actually pertains to relativism and the example reads as complete nonsense to me  especially this part  the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn t apply to them  as they do not weigh up the effects of their views  i do not think that  a  the majority in question believes that it doesn t apply to them though i m not sure what it is in this context  so the sentence may be true the majority believes that allowing  gay  marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society  which  of course  applies to everybody in that society  b  the majority in question does not weigh up the effects of its views its views are that  gay  marriage should not be allowed  for the benefit of society  it is aware of the effects  and does not object to them  ,0

and paganism  southgate  who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university  rejected catholicism and moved towards neo pagan and heathen groups that are very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition including the odinic rite  the tribe of the wulfings and the a satru alliance  a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard  mike  murray  a former member of the american  nazi  party further evidence of this  trans ition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan  the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins southgate believed that wotan s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented the most genuine expression of european spirituality  culture and identity another key expression of this identity is exhibited by southgate s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the pagan spirituality of the apostate roman emperor julian ii this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension  through the figure of christ  christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted  only the weak continue to worship a dead jew the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity  however  is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals  sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras  which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce and before spreading to the roman empire  although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century  mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers  including evola and jung  as an alternative path the west could have followed  it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or  latterly  himmler s ss which  the nrf claims  had its origins in various anarchist droite circles l e the black sun and the thule society  while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the aryan psyche the awareness of europe s faustian destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu  these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene gue  non who discerned in them the fragments of a hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth for southgate  as for evola  tradition is an an underlying current which both permeates and  trans cends all southgate s discovery of evolian primordial tradition and his consequent rejection of catholicism as the sole cosmological truth ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene this cultural vanguard is spearheaded by a number of gothic industrial  dark ambient  black and viking metal bands  including allerseelen  blood axis  burzum  current dark holler  death in june  endura  mayhem  ostara  puissance and sol invictus  though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda  their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could  thus providing the perfect antidote to the spiritually enervating  multiracial values of a globalizing system southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers  an interesting development given  exaggerated  reports of an emerging anti anti establishment pro bush right wing punk movement although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music orientated youth cultures  he believes a minority can be induced to take a direction basically conducive to our aims southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis  which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews this is not simply cynical manipulation  southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target  his fanzine  tribal resonance  the voice of the racial avant garde reveals southgate s strategy of linking his ideas to the common language and the big ideas of our culture through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives from without southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures  trans versally  as the  nazi s did  through a process of cultural osmosis that aims to recode the social symbology of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic  recalibrating its genetic inheritance  by creating cultural hegemony the groupuscular right believes it can forge the political space necessary for political and racial hegemony the struggle for cultural heg,0

addition of history as can be seen  i have added a new history section for the bank of liverpool previously there were just a few lines of intro  i have taken it up to when the bank acquired martins bank and became the bank of liverpool and martins  there already is separate article on martins which makes reference to the bank of liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive i propose continuing the bank of liverpool history to when the name was shortened to martins  and possibly beyond how should the overlap with the martins bank article be treated  the name change to martins is really a red herring it is the liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by barclays and therefore i suggest should be the main article  one solution would be to have martins pre history as a self contained article with the bank of liverpool article continuing up to ,0
 ok  i ll try to sort through your latest post here  let me know if i misinterpret something  first  you specify a theory  axiomatic system namely zfc p p p omega exists let s call that t  for easy reference  now you argue that t  proves the existence of a model  let s call it m the because it s not a model of t but of a new theory such that  m  satisfies zfc p p omega  is in m now  do you mean the real p omega or do you mean that m  satisfies p omega  exists that is  that there s an element of m  that m  thinks is p omega i m guessing the latter  that m  satisfies p omega  exists you say aleph  is in the model and is less than or equal to  the cardinality of  p omega again i m guessing you mean that this is in the model s opinion  that is  m  satisfies the statement exists and ok  so going with my guesses thus far  i agree that t  proves the existence of such an m m  might be  for example  m  g where m  equals which is a model for t and g is m  generic for the partial order to add  cohen reals ,0

 justin vaisse s opinion this relative absence of french american political and social unity helps to explain anti french sentiment in the united states  french historian justin va  sse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward france in the united states is the small number of americans of direct french descent http w politiqueinternationale com revue article php id revue id content  synopsis  while he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti french sentiments  he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly  without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness  va  sse contends that by comparison  the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval  he proposes that as france has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it  it is socially and politically acceptable in the united states to express negative sentiments of the frenchpierre verdaguer  a turn of the century honeymoon  the washington post s coverage of france french politics  culture society  vol no summer just to answer  i ve read before that the proportion of french descendant in the us is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the new world at the same time as the brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly  they were mixed into the mainstream america  however it s true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don t represent or try to represent  ,0

 proposed move to stiffness to weight ratio why is this article named with the least commonly used term for this property google returns results for specific modulus results for specific stiffness and results for stiffness to weight ratio i could understand this if wikipedia were advocating the term specific modulus e g  because it is shorter  or more technical sounding  or w hate ver however my understanding was that wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term in this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms this name has the further benefit of being self explanatory  whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text  which may well be why it is by far the commonest term i therefore propose moving this article to stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it this won t compromise findability in any way  but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term  ,0

legally  there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the schengen area  there are such criteria for joining the eu  but this is a different matter the only possibility to join the schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the eu  which includes a clause that schengen related eu law would be applicable in the associated non eu state  the associated state would only have the right to be consulted  thus  the u s  would have to accept each and every majority decision taken in brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not  and the u s  would have to accept that every third country national holding a residence title of a schengen state could enter the u s  without even being checked  to bil  guadeloupe and french guiana are not inside the schengen area because this would e g  require france to equip the complete rain forest border between french guiana and suriname  brasil etc  with high tech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border just in order to avoid id checks on flights between there and europe  i can understand why they do not invest any money into this ,0

 silesians andrew  i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you  i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia  i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia  but that is a separate project from this english project  assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia  i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst  i inquired about silesian polish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group  i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles  as i do not anticipate being able to copy edit the article further  i am removing it from my watchlist  good luck with the article  olessi thanks for you comments  and in fact fruitful discussion  you are right that the work of a person is most important  however  there are much present and past propaganda  which destroy the peace  if only some people would show objectivity and patience  as you did  it could be clear up  to mention nationality is however important  since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation unfortunately  nations or ethnic groups will still exist  i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them  and fair competition  seems to me that competition has to exit too best if for fun only i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects  but you see  when i approach german wiki  dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some german silesian polish guy  it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well  so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude  possibly i explained more my excitement with silesian is in short like this  originally  they were slavic tribe  spoke polish  as i mentioned  for some to hundred years there were under german governments  they had bad time as you possibly can imagine  many of them married with german and were are of course confused who they are  you know  the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polish german conflicts continued  finally in poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives  even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted  there in poland was complete disorder  soviets and communists arrived  most of them real simpletons any way  national government just pro soviet mafia  was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition  polish borders were shifted  we lost some of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland  you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all  some of them completely simple people  they spoke different polish dialect also  on top of this in the post war  pro soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground  well  i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds unfortunately i am  this is like gangrene on fresh wound  literally  thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland  which they wanted so much  i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans now  the present time  some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology they could be absolutely right  however  there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on november and governments effort to improve relations  finaly i have to say  i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often na  ve  not many realize that politic need caution  those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the na  ves  some procentage remember lectures of history  and objectively  too many germans are toublemakers  i am also convinced there exists something like national character  you can have obviously you own opinion  let me have my own  returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column  on polish terytory in addition sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle  wich i still have with ge wiki  they just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext  that  suck s sorry and thanks again  feel free to contact me any time you need  best regards andrew december,0

banging your head against a wall hi  i see jayjg has been leaving messages on your page  with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness in reality  jayjg is a rabid zionist and is trying to purge wikipedia of any negative information about zionism  and is trying to paint muslims in a bad light along with many of his cohorts the problem is that jayjg is part of the wikipedia cabal when there were elections  despite massive efforts to the contrary  a number of people got a higher vote percentage than jayjg but jimbo wales put him on arbcom anyhow jimbo has shown his true colors as well these people control wikipedia they are all together  and attacking you no one is coming to your aid this is because they control wikipedia  with jimbo at the center  and have more or less driven off everyone else you are banging your head against a wall here any massacre by zionists against palestinians will be covered up  disorted  justified etc anyone who attacks an israeli soldier will be castigated here my suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative  like a wiki encyclopedia that is not pro zionist and anti muslim like this one or if you do continue here for a little bit  to spend less time it is better to waste hours of time accomplishing nothing than eventually you will give up here  everyone does you are fighting a losing battle ,0

not tactics  you create a page about a non existant subsiduary  change all the links and then complain when things don t go your way  you created the chaos and then demand that others fix the problem that you created  you stuffed it you fix it  pretty simple in my book  things were pretty good until you invented the bmw motorrad subsiduary and changed everything  now that it has been shown that you were wrong you blame everyone else for the chaos caused by your arrogance  maybe returning things to how they were before you broke it would be a good idea  oh  an apology would also be good ,0

to father tanner  thank you for bringing some sanity to this article after having read the latest version  i must say that it very well balanced considering some of the horrible slanting that it experienced for a while there i would think that protecting the page is a good idea  even if it means my newly created account won t work  that is  if the tone remains such as it is presently  on fish campmore s blog  i have read through much of it mostly  it is complete trash the rest of it shows very poor scholarship at best the threads on it during july were very shrill and completely out of line i would not like to see it linked for those very reasons cecfan august ,0

current events story hi  i removed the story you posted on cuurent events for several reasons the story didn t seem to belong on the date where you placed it  if the story was reported in a newspaper dated january th  it shouldn t be listed under the january th events i know this may be an important story in belize  but  as far as i can tell  only one newspaper is carrying it and there are no hits on google news  it doesn t appear to be of global importance  which is usually what it takes to be included on current events the summary was way too long  two or three sentences is usually the maximum for a summary  if it wasn t for the first two points  i would have attempted to edit the summary instead of deleting  for now  i m going to remove the story  but if you can find more sources  please feel free to include a short summary and link on the correct date jan utc ,0

first of all  there s no need at all to apologise about discussing your dispute here  secondly  i think it would be a good idea  or actually an essential step in solving the dispute  to back off from this for a few days  maybe even a week  as you ve been back and forthing for months already  another week can t possibly hurt  you ll find that walking away and editing some articles unconnected with farming or with animal welfare will help put this whole hill of beans into its true perspective  it will give us time to find other  better  or at least more widely acceptable  images to use  after i am ready i will start a new section in article talk where we can take this matter forward and arrive at a solution we can all live with  how does that sound ,0

  wrong licenses i have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded  the exceptions are image wankhede mumbai jpg on the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free creative commons licenses  but failed to actually change the licensing  image dhoom  jpg concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a creative commons license  as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer  as such  the photo may not be used on wikipedia  except perhaps under fair use policy  which probably doesn t apply or under panorama freedom  depending on what the copyright law of india says on this topic image bipasha jpg image description page implies that it is licensed for non commercial use only  contradicting your copyright tag such a restriction is not acceptable on wikipedia  in addition  the link to the original source  which could clarify which condition is correct  of the image is missing image bom jpg the link to the original source at flickr is missing  author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved image chowpatti jpg to verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim  the author should probably e mail the wikimedia foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license image hydmall jpg the flickr page states that it is under a creative commons no derivative license  a license that prohibits the image to be modified used in derivative works is not acceptable on wikipedia  either image infobangalore jpg no evidence of the image being under a free license image brigaderoad jpg flickr page states all rights reserved image hoogly jpg the link to the original source at flickr is missing  author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved image haf jpg flickr page states all rights reserved image bangtemp jpg creative commons no derivative license image kolkahomes jpg all rights reserved image delhimall jpg creative commons attribution non commercial no derivative license  unacceptable on wikipedia image yamun jpg all rights reserved image kolk jpg all rights reserved image myspalbang jpg all rights reserved image bangalore jpg the link to the original source is missing  no evidence that it is under the creative commons license image lalbagh jpg taken from wikitravel  uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated image nagpur jpg who made this image there are several issues here  there are multiple creative commons licenses  not all of which are acceptable on wikipedia  in particular  licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can t be used on wikipedia  except as provided by the fair use policy  creative commons atrribution  and creative commons atrribution sharealike licenses are okay  also  there are multiple versions of the licenses  creative commons atrribution sharealike and are all distinct licenses the problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the versions and not the earlier ones  when the image is under one of the older licenses  you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number  as far as i can see  flickr only uses the versions of the licenses  in addition  some of the flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on wikipedia  without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses  a permission that only extends to wikipedia is not sufficient  either  you should ask the authors to do one of the following  change the flickr page to license the image under creative commons attribution  or attribution sharealike  license  apparently  this would change the licensing for all images  and this may not be what they intend to do post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following  i  creator of the image  agree to license it under the creative commons attribution license  link alternately  under the creative commons attribution sharealike license  link this declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page  e mail the wikimedia foundation  permissions en at wikimedia dot org  with a message similar to the above  also specifying which image  images  the user intends to release under the license this would be the best choice if the author doesn t want to reveal his identity on wikip,0

 israeli palestinian conflict protect yesterday there were relevent and reliably sourced casualty figures added to the israeli palestinian conflict article  and some editors objected to this  it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing  effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures  you cited edit warring  the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons  there are casualty figures in all the conflict  war  battle etc  wiki articles i have referenced  why not this one  thanks romac  the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only  which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years  this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity  the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself  here at wikipedia  we value the ability to achieve consensus  and to be fair to many viewpoints  and believe it or not  we often do achieve that at the article israeli palestinian conflict  it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable  without addressing any of the underlying issues  or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused  to repeat  statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article s lead  there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote  all in the name of objectivity  which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other  please note  this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus  rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus  i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz who argued that the statistics might be biased  do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source  please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably sourced and up to date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war  battle or conflict is disingenuous  if you or any other editor want to add more statistics  covering a longer time period  then go ahead  but do not delete relevant content added by other editors  yes  the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers  there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise  i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way  i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits  not to describe you personally in any way  if other editors deleted some edits  it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so  and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article  i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page  thanks  apology accepted  and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page  i am not a single issue editor i get around a bit on wiki  saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article  i can t say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material  i try to assume good faith  we ll see  repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons motive doesn t really matter  its still edit warring  its still disruptive  protection is not an endorsement of the current version  z man  the subject of this article is a deadly conflict  the lede is huge and yet it contains no mention of the casualties  clearly  there is something seriously wrong  as a result  your action here  while well intentioned  looks highly partisan  worse than that  it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers  those who wish to cover up atrocities  the mass killings of  mostly  unarmed civilians  in many cases recognised by western sources as war crimes  if the events at this article really offend you  it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version  talk ,0

 how did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject also  just because a word has a historical meaning doesn t mean that it can t ever mean anything else as culture develops  the word rap meant to knock  as on a door up until the late s for example  would you deny the more modern use of the term  the english language has no board to regulate it  as french does with the l acad  mie fran  aise  so you have no basis for defining what the word means  we have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like you re and your for example  but none such for words like bukkake  if it can be shown that it is used in a particular way  that is valid  my personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier  gay just as there is no need to call men having ass sex  gay  ass sex but that s really irrelevent  i think it is important to make clear the historical implications  but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language  even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake  splash from japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything  but specifically semen and specifically onto a person s face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it  but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it  ,0

 v fs max size this may sound random  but wikipedia led me astray on my home work and i should try to prevent it for others the given max size in the actual maximum was bytes  with singly indirect blocks and doubly indirect block  pwb unix s variant had singly indirect blocks  making the maximum bytes or half a mib  is incorrect  according to the version manual  http wlehre dhbw stuttgart de  helbig os v  doc v fs html  the max size is but cannot be larger than bue to only storing bits of filesize info in each inode rather than the number obtained above was the result of calculating it with byte addresses  which is obviously incorrect given the definition in the manual  ,0

 ropemarks bondage picture your recent move from bondage  bdsm  to bondage sex has caused the image link to the picture of a female bondage model i took at boundcon to break  the reason is that  because of frequent vandalism  this image was added to mediawiki bad image list  where it was set that it can only be shown at bondage  bdsm rope bondage and boundcon  your recent move requires a change to this list  but i m not sure how to go about to request such a change  talk  ,0

 i m back  i already created  id  occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class c when i do  i collected a massive number of diff edits on balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is  on record  getting  block  for saying this about greeks under a previous handle not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti greek rant fest pointing to questionable fyrom news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles no  ass  fuck  ers  has a nice ring to it d  use it as a pejorative term  i was ready to pull the trigger on both him  admin futper  and a few others  e g  macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united macedonia on his talk page  with a detailed complaint about anti greek propaganda but since futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles  rather than threats of blocking i m going to avoid escalating this further for now  ns  as for the current naming disputing article  i agree with you that some fyrom citizens honestly believe their claims but i don t think that reduces the existential threat to greece  communism fell years ago in yugoslavia and the fyrom government appears to be getting worse not better  imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic athenians and the cycle continues until their is no greece left there appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that fyrom leadership are confused about their own national identity  and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately i tried to add this to the talk page of the article but futper deleted it  arguing ancient macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient macedon wasn t greek  i didn t want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since i didn t think those facts should be censored either i thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course february the fyrom s president kirov gligorov  at an interview by the foreign information service daily report  easten europe  stated we are slavs  who came to the region in the sixth century  we are not descendants of the ancient macedonians  january the fyrom s ambassador in washington d c mrs  ljubica acevska  gave a speech on the present situation in the balkans  she stated we do not claim to be descendants of alexander the great  we are slavs and we speak a slavic language  greece is the fyrom s second largest trading partner and its number one investor  february the fyrom  s ambassador to canada  gyordan veselinov  in an interview with the ottawa citizen he admitted we are not related to the northern greeks who produced leaders like philip and alexander the great  we are slavs and our language is closely related to bulgarian  there is some confusion about our identity  i think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister s recent behavior  he directly contradicts fyrom s own government s previous comments about themselves  that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that greeks were imagining fyrom propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names in order to get recognition prime minister gruevski officially meets prince ghazanfar of pakistan  who claims to be related to alexander the great then uses it as an opportunity to suggest fyrom citizens are related to ancient macedonians and don t get me started on that incident where gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of united macedonia was clearly present  which also seems to be missing from the existing article ,0

articles ive just deleted the bug r r team  or however that was spelled and notice other deletion requests on other articles here  i also read your note on that article s talk page  and think you may be misunderstanding the purpose of wikipedia  we only allow articles on subjects that are notable  generally  this means that they have been discussed in detail in multiple  independent reliable sources  that means that a company that s just recently started  that has never produced a product  and that  by the way those were written  seem closer to a group of friends  is not a suitable subject for a wp article  basically  if you can t find a number of newspaper  etc articles discussing the company  it shouldn t have an article  i hope this explains why these articles were deleted in connection to this  i need to ask you to stop creating articles on businesses of this type  continuing to do so adds extra work for other editors and administrators  and these are clearly non notable companies  so much so that we used the expedited speedy deletion process  ,0
hello friend just to tell you that i cannot tolerate wrong information on wikipedia you guys have to give all aspects of a information  be it good  bad  acceptable  unacceptable  or controversial  without hiding anything to make the information complete wikipedia is the information people trust upon  so it implies that has to be true  be bold  that is how you can bring a change  you are in the position to do just that one who fears  has a very good reason  that he cannot face the truth ,0

 outdent  how about looking at it like this  rpg rulebooks are just that  the rulebook explains how to play the game  but it is not the game itself  the isbn manual you reference below supports this  games shall not be given isbns  there may be some confusion in the matter  but one good example is found by harking back to ad d nd ed  to play that game required  it being rules heavy  that really is pretty much true  a minimum of two books the dm guide and the players  handbook  neither contained the game  and the game went far beyond what was in either  the game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books  magazine articles  supplements  pamphlets  online articles and what was in the head of the players  the book is about the game  it is not the game  for that matter  a number of the articles you tagged did not list an isbn  so you can t really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the isbn  a publisher doesn t mean it s a book  as board games  computer games  and any number of things are published and have publishers  ,0

 discussion boards are almost the lowest form of life on wp rs  only just above comments sections on blogs however if you can demonstrate that glf has written this  and the fact that it has appeared under his name on a forum that he has moderating rights on may indicate this although he does not use a stared account which means it could be an imposter the daily mirror account seems to be totally derivative of the guardian  and the guardian does not say that glf was a member of the bnp just that their journalist contacted him and he said that he could not be active the daily mirror could well have lost the subtelty of what the guardian said i wouldn t like to be their libel lawyer on that  with all of this  and knowing glf s propensity to sue i am going to cut this out the fact that the cda is to the right of the conservative party is pretty well established in the article  ,0

 i was thinking about this last night  and came to two conclusions  first  focusing solely on this article is not the way to go  i need to go back to square one and add academic rigor  if possible  to global warming and denialism don t tell me gw is fa and is therefore academically rigorous  the fa star does not even come within discus throwing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous second  your system of defending this wikipedia page  notice i didn t say article is completely airtight  because you hold control over all of the definitions  join any high school debate team and they ll tell you  if you own the definitions  you own the debate  and the problem here is this  you define anyone who disagrees with agw as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert  done  the page is impregnable  take forex the quote by democratic senator barbara boxer  using her comments as supporting evidence of the page s  not article s  thesis is a flagrant act of pov that proves this page  not article is an op ed piece from start to end  barbara boxer is a politician  every bit of power  money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only  to characterize herself as a noble public servant  and stereotype her opponents as villains  buffoons or both  even more and this is important barabara boxer is not a run of the mill politician  it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is  in short  the boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what test  i intend to delete that one sometime soon too  i also wonder whether i should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank you to the editors who revert me  every time they do so  or maybe a barnstar  i dunno  some token of gratitude or other  ,0

 not happy i am not happy with the tone of this comment  you seem to be confused firstly  are you seriously saying that as product manager  visualeditor team you are completely unable to give a useful answer to a question about what the plans for mathematics rendering are or what progress has been made against those plans does mathematics rendering really have nothing whatsoever to do with visual editor or is there some other reason why you prefer not to answer the question  secondly  if you wanted to be helpful  instead of airily alluding to the volunteers who maintain that extension you might have said who they are who are the people to whom  in your opinion  i should address that question  please  thirdly  if you really wanted to be helpful  and i am finding it hard to avoid the conclusion that you do not  you might even have volunteered to pass the question on to the approriate people rather than batting it back so unhelpfully  once again  if you engage constructively with the volunteer mathematics editor community  it is likely to prove of benefit to the project so far i m seeing less of a serious attempt to engage and too much petty point scoring  ,0

you should familiarize yourself with the situation before blocking editors under wikipedia policy  under the  rr rule  it states that leeway will be given to editors whose reverts undo vandalism and or help improve the article  there is a solution to the edit warring that has been accepted by most editors  that is to leave the  rd paragraph of the lede as is until objections suggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it  which is also according to wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution  if you familiarize yourself with this from the talk page  you ll observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion  without explanation  without stating their objections first  without submitting their proposed changes to peer review  and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring  i am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution  because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators  i have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of  if you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreed upon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes ,0

deleted response to comments on wikipedia talk wikiproject ships please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia  in this particular case  the discussion was started by user brad  who made a personal comment about me  now  i dont mind this  i was more curious than offended  but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which i started on wikipedia talk naming conventions  ships you claimed that my post which you deleted was a  pov inserted into a neutral notice it may have been a pov  about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later  but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work  and thus the implicit pov that it was undesireable  it was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting if you are going to start censoring postings  then i would suggest you do so impartially you did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice  but merely removed one comment  rather than restoring impartiality  this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate far better that you do not delete anyones comments  i would suggest reading wikipedia no personal attacks  i m not sure what deleting others posts comes under  try wikipedia etiquette ,0

 pretty much what i said the first day this was posted  now  i have neither a problem with the cabal s decision nor in the cabal s logic  as deamon does my concern is why a vote that basically said i don t know means it stays at burma  by the cabal s conclusion if the article had happened to be frozen at myanmar before the mediation  and we had the same cabal  it would now be a myanmar article  i can see where the myanmar side would be unhappy  however why should the burma side agree to abide by the next decision  you can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with burma  husond is right  where does this end  when i first looked at this mess i said  and posted  that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will not be able to reach a fair compromise that will appease both sides of this issue  no matter how much thought is put into it  there are good points for each argument  i m in the burma camp but that is how i see things  so i m looking at leave it where it is now split it into identical articles some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination  choice just doesn t look that appealing  ,0

the lead is quite unbalanced  as it is supposed to be a brief summary and introduction to the main text  and yet is about historical cultural religious aspects of circumcision  which only occupies a small portion of the article itself i agree that information in the lead should be in the article under the relevant section  perhaps as the opening paragraph  but given there are already articles for religious practices  it is unnecessary in the lead it could be reduced to one  or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical  cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision but without going into detail this is a medical article  and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision only where medical circumcision has itself become part of cultural practice should there be a focus on that manifestation of circumcision as cultural practice ,0

with respect  you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country  getting off the subject a little  but it does have some relevance  the nz herald routinely refers to nz ers of european descent as  pakeha where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating although this attitude is softening  of course i would not include this in any article  and defintely not this one  without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research  i note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country  what is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of  hits  for rooster found in nz media  many of these hits will be refering to the australian league club sydney roosters and not the poultry  clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the country s readership than poultry  just stating both  cock erel  and  rooster  are used is factual  whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data  and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject  also  i can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both  cock erel  or  rooster  are common ,0

 summary of the afd debate negative votes delete the original editor was user ivygohnair so it was marked as a vanity article for violating wp auto mapetite strong delete ignorance of the rules is not a valid argument for keeping an article  vyse neutral positive votes procedural nomination  speedy a  was applied  but was contested and this warrants a further look  i m neutral for now  even though this article doesn t seem to be colourburst comment question csd a  is unremarkable people  groups  companies and websites is that the reason for the afd too  according to wikipedia vanity guidelines as explained below  an author s conflict of interest by itself is not a basis for deletion  but lack of assertion of notability is  edward wakelin it is true that i have come into the fray to defend ivy goh nair from speedy deletion and that her last page was actually uploaded by me  i think if you want to apply the vanity label because one person edits the other and vice versa  it would only be fair to examine each case on its own merit  both user ivygohnair and user chandrannair are established figures in the field that is being discussed  ie singapore literature and writing  secondly  it should be considered in their favour that they have used their own names and not fictitious names as user names  if this had been the case  the problem wouldn t have arisen  therefore i think there is much merit in user  edward wakelin remarks above and that an author s conflict of interest is by itself not a basis for deletion  out by wikipedia  chandrannair  talk contribs comment  let s be nice to newcomers  as per wikipedia please do not bite the newcomers  this seems like a case where newcomers not knowing the rules here  an author of bestseller may be notable enough to get an article in an encyclopedia  perhaps this biography needs some fixing  as per wikipedia biographies of living persons  deleting is probably unnecessary  pfhlai i have read her book  though i m not from singapore and it s better than a lot of the stuff that makes it to the ny times best seller list  the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk contribs new to all this in wikipedia  i think the mood to delete is harsh  this is a user who seems to have made a definite impact in a small place  and is trying to popularise the creative energies of singapore  let us be more forgiving  besides it looks there is actual published reviews as testament to the work  mcporpington mcporpington sorry i meant to add to my comment above that the article should not be deleted  mcporpington mcporpington hi i am saddened to read such biting  petty comments and suggestions about deleting this article  this person has clearly contributed to singapore literature and has also been cited by others  signed phillygal i did my military service in singapore and i love the country  i vote to keep  i do not see any conflict of interest herejean louis retrieved from http en wikipedia org wiki wikipedia articles for deletion ivy goh nair ,0

 rsa labss  now emc mit  and acm are wrong vquaker i am used to accepting correction when it is due  but for the life of me i cannot understand why cited information from a primary source  rsa labs  on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing i am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know  it must be spurious some people know that it s better to get their legal information from government sources  not wikipedia if you are holding up this resource as some type of cfr or usc guide  exposition  or sanctioned resource  then i believe the u s  government would like to hear your ideas further  someone you know or knows you  is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat though  i suspect you know this already i m not offended though  just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard i would ask you this  if a user loses their smartcard  i e  cac  and forgets their password  with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed  in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated  or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person there are organizations that will terminate you  but i couldn t have said that in my expounding of the  th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay i do hope i can talk without citing what those in df and is would consider common knowledge  when we set out  it was to provide reliable information  if the mission has changed  well who could tell consider me a non contributor from now onwe aren t allowed to use wikipedia anyway where i work  it is an anathema say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued  i should expect nothing less  after all  i teach what changed the tone was your  dumb ing down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone smell non sequitur you gave me things to read  but i m still waiting for you to cite wikipedia s policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister i cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style  organization  and applicability be in line with one or more regulatory bodies now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases  do you have access to them  elsevier  jstor  edas  ie  springerlink they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you re stuck in a google funk  but i digress  are full of references to fourth factor that cash register key the manager uses when you return something  yep  someone you know an that s been around for decades sign up for an account with an isp  there it is again take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful i just didn t realize you alone set these standards i repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly  ,0

 organisations also count as things the section you quote from wp name is in the section titled use english words which goes on to say sometimes the usual english version will differ somewhat from the local form as in franz josef strauss  and rarely  as with mount everest  it will be completely different  this is clearly a case where the usual english version differs somewhat wikipedia naming conventions  political parties  carries several exceptions  the third exception is parties whose name is more commonly known by acronyms than their full name in international newsmedia  since gpv is more commonly known by its acronym  this naming convention does not apply there is no problem with ambiguity  since there are no other topics in wikipedia that carry the name gpv even if there were  this article would then be named gpv  political party  to disambiguate them  in conclusion  please read naming conventions in full before quoting them to me also  please demonstrate that gpv is not the most commonly used name in english for this party  which you have not yet done  thank you  ,0
tangential forces the tangential forces  coriolis and euler  can be applied to a system but they don t occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism  but that is off topic during the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that i was confused between the two we can apply a coriolis force or an euler force to a system if we like  the euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co rotating radial motion in a rotating frame of reference with non uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious euler force acting tangentially in a keplerian orbit  there will be zero tangential acceleration  although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite euler force and coriolis force having said all this  tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article  they could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force  the centrifugal force is an outward radial force more attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the  radial distance  variable they they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about ,0

yes you re right  theologically catholicism is very different to american protestantism which gave birth to the creationist movement and are certainly not interested in the sort of fundamentalist theocracy that most of them want sure  they use the teleological argument  but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isn t pseudoscience  which is what irks me as a scientist but i don t understand theology  probably because i ve been trained to think too scientifically and the catholic church most of the time has better things to do than make statements on scientific issues but catholics are really into authority  so what the hierarchy says  goes  dunc ,0

a consistent conceptualization of phylogenies  phylogenies  i e dictomously branching processes  are processes that involve things  that is  objects  and as such have to be modeled by object oriented modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects  darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects  and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects  like a sex ly reproducing cells or mitochondria now  as an object oriented model  the model actually represents two consecutive objects  i e two objects in a row  by each of its internal lines  i e lines between nodes one after a node and one before a node  the former belonging to the category  i e concept objects after nodes  and the latter to the category  objects before nodes if the model includes all objects of a certain category  then both of these make up this category  in summary  phylogenies consist of two categories  i e concepts  of objects  objects before nodes and objects after nodes  and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category  then these two categories make up this category  cladistics  or cladism as i prefer to call it  confuses the concept  objects after nodes  with the concept  objects before nodes  by defining lines between nodes as single things  thereby confusing category with object  that is kind with thing  thus confusing conceptualization itself  the approach is actually a return to a pre scientific stage  this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently  it is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate  if this approach could ever be proved to be correct  then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads  luckily  einstein s discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach  i e claim and this it did even before the approach was born  cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged consist  presently at ,0

  your source states  about the black white difference in iq  which at the time was about points  the neisser et al article stated  there is not much direct evidence on this point  but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis  that conclusion stands today  there has been no new direct evidence on the question see rushton jensen a b  gottfredson and lynn vanhanen for the view that the black white iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative  see nisbett for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value  please stop lying then applying the same defintion to c the answer is no  do you see the problem here question c is the hereditiarian position a mainstream view the question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the iq test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors  note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view  nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap  but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars  yes question d is richard nisbett considered a mainstream scientist the question is whether nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of psychology  the question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included  but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article  no  nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having  virtually no chance of being true  by a reliable tertiary source ,0

your argument is that we should take your word over that of the sources  all you have said is your own personal opinion and original research rather than facts supported by reliable sources  as i stated earlier  present reliable sources stating otherwise if you disagree with the sources given  secondly  there is nothing wrong with the integrity of the sources given  you claim that the global financial centres index commissioned by the city of london corporation must be biased because it is based in london  you fail to mention the other two sources given  forbes and mastercard  both of which are american and based in new york city  nor do you provide any sources supporting your notion that the city of london corporation is a biased institution  it is clear from this argument that the article faces two choices  it can go with thmc  s own personal opinion and original research  or the word of the city of london corporation  forbes  and mastercard ,0

direktor  after all that we have been through  i believe that we can clearly see ceha s nationalist bigotry  here it goes again  what disturbes me the most is that he is claiming this much detail  one thing is to make a map  the other thing is to make a map that has such detail like his proposed map does  but  do not worry  yesterday i figured out how to make a nice map and am currently working on it ,0
  october utc  hi tom  i understand and you don t have to convince me of the similarities  it s just that wp requires citations to reliable sources  in this case where the author of a book or a music paper article or a professional website like allmusic has made the connection  so those examples above  though worthwhile in themselves  don t solve the  citation needed  issue  however i m sure i ve seen the mona how soon is now connection made in at least one book on the smiths so let me scout around and see if i can find it  take care and tks for stopping by to discuss  cheers ,0

 ec with moni  or that using say  dictionary of national biography articles is better than using oxford dictionary of national biography articles  because the first is free to everyone and the second is only free to uk library subscribers  never mind the year difference in scholarship  and the turgid prose and edwardian victorian pov i ve seen it argued that we should use the dnb before the odnb  it s like competence isn t required to edit  merely civility  which is so wrong on so many counts it s not even funny  i took the latest wikipedia foundation survey today  and found it unsettling  more questions seemed aimed at how close is editing wp to fb  and what would make it cooler more social media etc to you does no one remember we re supposed to be writing an encyclopedia talk  ,0

 they should know immediately what it sounds like  it has highly distorted guitars  shrieking vocals  etc but what defines black metal apart from other forms of music that also use distortion and screaming  punk rock and indie may well have ideologies  but black metals different values are easily identifiable and unique  you all seem intent on giving black metal a disservice by simply labelling it as angry music  if you cared about the genre  you wouldnt  and lol at thinking burzum has no ideology  if you are the kind of person that thinks that then you don t know enough to edit this article  the problem with of wikipedia to someone who is a non listener  the fact that black metal has an uncompromising ideology is rather useless as a description why  wouldn t they want to know also nice to see the page locked  go listen to cradle of filth you complete tits  you re all untermensch ,0

 trunkarchive com hi  daniel i noticed you  block  user trunkarchive i suspect this user s activities formed part of a concerted promotional effort on the part of trunkarchive com  a media licensing company  to create bio articles on as many of the photographers in their stable as possible here are the other accounts  neither currently active  who may have been involved photofan s contributions consist almost entirely of creating articles about photographers represented by trunkarchive com several were deleted  see user talk photofan but a good many have survived  perhaps some  are speediable g or a those that are not i could conceivably bulk nominate to afd  with the exception of any that meet wp creative even those that remain should probably have the els to trunkarchive com removed under wp elno links to web pages that primarily exist to sell products or services i ve also added trunkarchive com to the list of proposed additions at mediawiki talk spam blacklist  does this seem like a reasonable course of action ,0
 hie dvdm  i was writing what follows while you made your edit  i can t right now  but i will coming to review in detail your example  thanks johnuniq for your advice and input  concerning the actual statement  i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm  i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late s  early s  adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats  but that s not the really important issue here  the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the  you call it blog  site is not a reliable source here  but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or alexander abian are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia  and the sourced site is reliable there  btw  in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned  the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis  it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being  and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts  the links will be trashed out  at this point the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote  in most cases some synthesis is involved there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source  it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay  is leading editors to substitute verifiability  intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority  this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia  once lauded as the place to come as you are  becoming stiff  purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding  this in turn carries into a discussion about public education  and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for  cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so  to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting  but that maybe just my own personal opinion  and wikipedia users having them available is positive  constructive and enriching for wikipedia  and that s the reason i linked to them in the first place  throwing them out  all of them  seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things  the baby with the bath water  because a wikipedia directive says so  just because it does  not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening  it would seem to me  not to exclude good things by statute  so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length  ,0
 let s see if i can answer in an orderly fashion lead the point is that it was very much his own style  his trade mark looking at the sentence now  it makes perfect sense  please do  i agree  that sentence was not hatched it was contrived will think about it  suggestions welcome why not  i was just afraid that the article would be top heavy with a longer lead  i ll just put it in my notes for tomorrow  it s too late for me to think right now general learned something new here  thanks  please do  i ve gone blind on the article for the moment early life my usual errors  not combining words  please correct  thanks talk  ,0

the particular section lists what has been claimed in rebuttal to the code theft charge that the claims regarding the significance of c to c  trans lation and bit conversion seem spurious  false or dubious to c c programmers are acknowledged that the medievia web page makes blatantly false statements about dates  the origination of other muds  and the significance of the above i also acknowledge i don t believe the article section is about uncovering the truth of their claims the only fact necessary to presenting that viewpoint is that they ve claimed it also presenting a lengthy history of public proclamations and announcements by the games principals which contradict their own official web history page is beyond the scope  i think  of what most people care about ,0

arji  what makes you think this assertion is mistaken  it is not my assertion  it is the conclusion of this agencies report  taken to be reputable enough to be run by several respectable news carriers around the world  naming me a troll is a classy touch  and calling for all dialogue with me to cease should be grounds for your indef banning from wikipedia the fact that you and kim don t believe the conclusions does not matter  the evidence passes wp v and wp rs  the evidence has been released to the media and no one of repute  that s not you kim btw  has challenged the validity or accuracy of the study  the fact that the study doesn t include chinas massive underground coal mine fires only helps the conclusions of the report ,0
 firstly  some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages maybe you should read your own posts also  the reason i decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what i had said perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what i said but they did not apply to what i said and meant perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what i mean and try not to take offense so easily i am respecting the basic rules of wikipedia  but i also exploited loop holes in the rules so if you want to include what i did in the rules then do so  but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning and i m so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total  ass hole s to me and to another person who tried to post this same page you asked that we do something  i e  explain the significance of the clan  etc  and we did but you deleted it anyway and then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us also  one of the pages i read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth well what kind of bull shit  is that if this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth also  if i go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then i can site that and it becomes verifiable right if you say no  then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight ,0

 elelland  hello humus  i am sorry if i have placed this note in the wrong spot  i m very inexperienced with wikipedia  i was enthralled by wikipedia  initially  that is until i met eleland  i noticed that you had some interesting discussions with eleland  eleland engineered a small article which i contributed some information to be deleted  he organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus the article was on ed o loughlin fairfax publishing mideast correspondent  the said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary  he was amongst the candidates for this year s hr com dishonest reporter award despite being in the australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism anyway eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted so i studied eleland a little i ve looked at over of his posts on the arab israel conflict  more than were directly anti israel  his modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro israel side  in this way he has undermined many many articles personally i don t care what his opinion is  but when he uses his editorial power and influence at wikipedia to falsely invalidate  delete  manipulate etc  i think there is a problem wikipedia is  i am afraid  beginning to read like eleland wrote the script who is eleland  what power does he actually have can anything be done adon emmet  if you post a reply here i will contact here or even by e mail ,0

 misleading reference to study in the section on lead paint in art  which i largely wrote someone added the following lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time  this is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids  often from fingerprints as a result  many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration  as i found this surprising  i went and carefully read the study being cited  their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper  although that wasn t absolutely clear  but lead paint is almost never used that way  artists working in  trans parent watercolor  aquarelle  don t usually use white paint  or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead  to make corrections  and opaque watercolors  gouache  and acrylic  polymer  artist s paints typically use titanium dioxide or  rarely  zinc white  but never lead  normally flake white is used only by oil painters  and there s no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints  cooperstown is a well respected institution  but as of now i m sticking with the classic  ralph mayer flake white may get  slightly  yellowish after centuries  but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above  if someone has more information on this  please mention it here  otherwise when i come back i m going to delete that paragraph or water it down  no pun intended ,0

there is definately a major difference between caucasian and white users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article  and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view  cited sources or not  it s obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite  and or choose not to but this article as it exists is just wrong i believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article  and adding a new sub section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what of the people on this earth consider a  white person  to be  this obviously not including alun slrubenstein when it comes down to it  the term  white person  can t really be defined  it s technically not a race  and any references sited are going to be garbage  as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another all that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with  or delete it entirely  but as it currently exists  i say again it s a joke you can cite all the references you want  and state all the wikipedia rules you want  you just can t understand that what you believe just isn t what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does  and as i said before  there s no way of either side proving the case for either side here  as  white people  don t scientifically exist so  since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause  even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a  white person  is  just do us all a favor and either delete this article  since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you  get over it  and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesn t scientifically exist end commafest ,0

 addressing  while indian tribe is official us gov t lingo  saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward  also the tribe is not a monolithic entity  but rather a collection of people so maybe reword to say something like the coeur d alene people once inhabited acres ha  in northern idaho and washington and montana  actually  note article on the tribe  but today  the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the coeur d alene reservation in benewah and kootenai counties  idaho you don t have to use my wording  but you see how i am distinguishing land and people  though the two are  of course  closely intertwined boomer  second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit  i d put right up front that johnson did the executive order but congress never acted on it  then go on about how the tribe didn t accept it anyway keep the chronology clearer  interesting that the coeur d alene article says nothing about this period  maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too  hm from a very cursory review of the decision  it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and idaho s statehood becomes significant in this case  so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact  but it s something that s going to matter  the section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining  maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the scotus case  ,0

 pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offline hi i m not quite sure how this works  but your wrote in my deletion review  you say that your name and address are available  but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous  does this mean i hadn t registered  i did so last night  and not under a pseudonym as most people have  i always use my real name in signatures and i don t know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link thanks  dennis bathory kitsz bathory bathory org bathory maltedmedia com  thanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear whether you register or not doesn t really matter since anyone can register under any name i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w  bush  at least  if it s not already taken wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself  that s what i meant by pseudonymously any registration  even if you say that it s your real name  is technically a pseudonym it is not independently verified against some external identity database and for the most part  that works out very well on wikipedia we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits  not by making claims to outside credentials by the way  anyone could also register as dennis bathory kitzs that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system such a person could sign their name the same way you do  attempt to mimic your pattern of speech  well  writing really  and make subtle edits just to discredit you that  in fact  is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users  we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia but those are all manual checks there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it likewise  no one can inherently trust the email address the way internet domains are set up  anyone could register bathory org and create any email name they wanted like wikipedia accounts  emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority and that s before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit most people are honest but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn t matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not that s why wikipedia has a policy against original research  which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on self published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large  well known organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing sorry to bore you with all this but my non wikipedia profession is information security the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours how can a bank know that you re really you and how far can that trust be extended under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible unfortunately  there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate  anyway  i ll get off my soapbox now thanks for your message to post to my talk page  just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki markup symbols you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes when you save the page  the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date timestamp again  welcome to wikipedia  talk ,0

  quoting from the article rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered  in part because she dressed in expensive clothing which served to alienate her from those suffering the privations caused by the war  and windsor castle  about miles kilometres  west of central london so  the views that you express are already represented in the article  it seems fair and well balanced to me  making it critical is not what wikipedia is about  we should not be a platform for political views  but an encyclopedia presenting facts  ,0

 the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory  it can t  because langan is not a member of academia  but then again  a theory need not be academic to be notable  for example  print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well  nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness  scholarly integrity  or intellectual merit  except possibly in the well indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves  and of course  their aspiring apprentices  whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article  this is correct  to his credit  he invites others to tag his assertions  however  this is a bit specious  for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant  verifiable assertions to make  he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others  thus  we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langan s assertions receive a separate citation  when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article  it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents  not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article  but given that the article already links to ample source material  anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false  irrelevant  or non neutral  unfortunately  he hasn t yet been able to lock onto this signal  he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat  he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself  by now  everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization  neither byrgenwulf  nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates  has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations  they are merely using the article  which is faithful to the material it cites  to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic  the ctmu  which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks  they do not like what the ctmu says  the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says  and what langan and the press say about the ctmu  hence  they do not like the article on the ctmu  this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulf s  trans parent strategy of attacking the theory through the article  attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger  meanwhile  he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy  and that his all too evident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well  oozing contempt  byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands  snide remarks  and self righteous  factually worthless criticism but not one relevant citation in hand  nothing he says is verifiable  as we have now repeatedly seen  he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert  this makes it very difficult  if not impossible  to take his demands seriously  ,0

 september utc  i ll try to take the points in turn  hope i get this format right wp blpgossip states that be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources  i am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources  i am not sure how the section applies  if you could be more clear it would be helpful the phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance  by this metric  so little can be used that it s almost meaningless  someone stating their birthdate  or the grade school they attended  but for a person saying i have a conflict with jenny smith over issue x where do we draw the line  it could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing  with one placing on their personal  publicist  website a statement about separating for reasons of x is a claim about third parties but i wouldn t argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual  one can take things too far  and i think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense ,0

mr i don t mean to be frank but your title does assert that so is a de factor a country when only a handful number of countries recognizes it as such  the majority of the world still see it as a part of georgia after all it was and is a civilwar  on top of that south ossetians abkahzians are russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the russian federation  this is also the problem logically  to call it as such  is to recognize the regional sovereignty of that area therefore confirming that the region exist but many speak of it which confirms it s existence now that the region is confirmed to exist what is this region part of  it is for the most part still the georgian region its more to do with logic then pov  my friend mr i m trying front with you whatsoever but that statement so war doesn t make sense to me  however i think that the solution is probably like pubkjre said in regards to the vietnam article but this needs to stop any title can seem that it has a pov and can have great arguments to support it even though the title has good intentions so to debate it any further wouldn t do good  every informational data base has a bias its just a question of how much furthermore i m going to also defend the google searches because it a good way to see how many individuals speak of in reference to  i am not saying that because everyone calls it as such then it should be so  but the easier it is to find the better as illogical as that sounds in summation i second pubkjre we should have a etymology page that way it will be clear on who is using what name and why ,0

  whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation in this case  organic remains  was added to explain the word  they while w m  used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition  recently buried remains  such as what is now occurring are not fossils from the dictionary of geologic terms rd edition by bates and johnson fossil any remains  trace  or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth s crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time nothing buried in the present can be a fossil  for it is in historic time and further  you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them  you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era w m  likely used the term fossil loosely  like many editors of this wp page  to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future it is unfortunate that w m  were not as precise as they might have been  because uninformed people  such as talk origins  misunderstand and twist what they said as much impact as w m  have had on creationary thought  nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that the genesis flood  is now way out of date modern creationary geologists have moved well beyond the genesis flood when critics quote it  it displays their complete lack of competency on modern creationism  ,0

 question sarah  there is something that i ve wondered about for a long time that is related to coi editing one need look no further than my user page where i quote chris hedges they control our systems of information  and add  surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate approved encyclopedia at a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily led  lame brained  losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy what  if anything  is presently being done i m aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to prove that he had no coi related to the articles he edits  and i ve heard of this incident dozens of times since  where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest many times i ve wondered how wikipedia went about finding this so called proof  if i put myself in a position in which i was editing for pay but denied it  how could it be proven that i was i mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have wp give him her the wp stamp of approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please they can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check  ,0

 colorado balloon incident greetings  i reverted your addition of a news photograph of the colorado balloon incident balloon  unfortunately  wikipedia s use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography  as the template you used states use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a  trans formative nature  when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts it s intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image  even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography  wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non free media compromises the freely licensed status of wikipedia  refer to the first rule at wp nfcc  non free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible  there were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike  almost any would do for the purposes of the article  wikinews claims that the balloon was low flying and that photographs were captured by area residents  the best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one  the effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down  i ve been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry  though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs i hope i haven t given the impression that i do not appropriate your contributions to the article as i do  especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably  thanks for your contributions  ,0
 this is a potentially ridiculous article seriously  it is a potentially ridiculous article  and mislead readers to comprehend the word x for the following reasons should sort amd or intel implementations as x generally x was used to point all the processors compatible with ia isa  might or might name themselves with such as cyrix  x intel pentium and so on  amd s long mode is devised by amd rather than intel  so how can one sort them together  nowadays software labeled themselves as x are ia compatible software  and use x or x differentiating with it  so this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word generations  what is the  th generation x processor  who invented this kinda processors  amd k  just says that it succeeds amd k  rather than saying it is the  th x processor  and i ve never heard intel call their x processors exceeding the  th generation  and one thing should never be denied  the first generation of itanium processor says its family model number as which might potentially imply that itanium might be the  th x processor succeeding pentium i  but none confirmed this  so take turn back the  trans meta s crusoe and efficeon  if the morph firmed on the system board implements x decoder call themselves as x processors  then if put the same processor on another board implementing powerpc decoder  then it would be the powerpc processor  at this situation  what kind of processor is it  ridiculous  what s more for what sort it as the  th  th generation x who is another jane austen  making up another northanger abbey x is one architecture isa  name  what such a ridiculous thing that i ve ever heard on earth  x is used to referring the processor  a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture  if it were the name of an architecture  then in this logic way  intel is one of the implementation of this architecture ,0

 undent  this was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page see archive the consensus was that hagee is covered adequately in john mccain presidential campaign hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article the relationship  if one can call it that  between hagee and mccain was much more remote and brief than that between obama and wright many elections nowadays feature guilt by association games  but obama wright tucc is a bit different  because the coverage went on so long during the campaign  and the relationship went on so long in real life if hagee turns out to bedevil mccain as much as wright and tucc has affected obama  it would merit inclusion here in this main mccain article there are hundreds of other items in the sub articles also  picking out just hagee to add to this main article  and not picking out those other hundreds of items  would cause undue weight  this article is about mccain s whole life  not just the current campaign  and in the context of his whole life hagee is just not very significant  if a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election  then the person can go to the article about mccain s campaign  which has a couple paragraphs about hagee in writing this article  dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are  and those that aren t quite as important don t make the cut right now  some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his vietnam service before the shoot down  or more on mccain feingold  or more on his relations with the republican party in the early s  as compared to more about hagee ,0

 alex  thank you for your reply  i could indeed use a break from this case  but yesterday was a very eventful day  as the case closed and then agk answered a question i d initially posed on august meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof  and then when it made the response  it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof  if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs  he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text  for example  had been under direct discussion regarding the perceived legal threat  i had no intention to make a legal threat  that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case  starting with newyorkbrad s comment on my fof on august to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday  more than two weeks later  there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk  which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point  after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney  or w hate ver they re called in scotland it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion and when did a little looking around there  finding an entry about nyb  for example  who had advised agk that he didn t see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof  so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney  if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine  note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue there s much more to say on this  but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep  i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbo s talk page  but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation  not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel  for instance  with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions  and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished  i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system  ,0
i found a better reference  in  page theoretically  polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms  polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time  polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men  and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women of these  only the first is common and on page a statistical analysis of kaingang genealogies for a period of years showed that per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages  as compared with per cent for polyandrous per cent for polygynous  and per cent for monogamous unions the disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive  but they aren t checked out often either  this had been sitting on the shelf for over years  deep in the recesses of the basement  murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage ,0

 further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article  which should be sourced wp citelead does require editors to add redundant citations i e  if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead  the first two sections of the article detail  trans cripts  in which  hitler  proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards  sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent  indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life  instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so  if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it  please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence  it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes  tags only alert editors to a potential problem  but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it  ,0

how is a list of his appearances on other people s albums  trivia it s basic discographical information  and as you can see  it s standard content for rappers  discographies  also  the sources in the album articles must be sufficient if the album listings themselves don t need to be sourced  which seems to be the case per other high quality articles  bob dylan discography  elvis presley discography  the beatles discography  etc  i could see a case for sourcing anything that doesn t have its own article  however ,0

 kenneth tennyson s reckless behavior in other forums as far as kenneth tennyson bashing other authors  here is an exerpt from a book review on amazon com founder of the homemade mushindo karate movement  never studied under a legitimate teacher  or any martial art teacher  never set foot in asia  completely disproven  shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources  of course he claims to have studied under masters in tibet  and been a disciple of okinawan karate teachers since disproven by such worthy sources as gorge mattson  et al  was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back sleep with me and i ll enlighten you kinda thing uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex students say at him  a propaganda liemaster  the person he is bashing is none other than terrence dukes  or the real frank dukes from the movie bloodsport while putting others down  kenny brags  or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people hm  well  kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera  alot of jumping and posturing  and a lot of religious themes to it  i guess it depends on what martial arts you ve trained in to determine whether i can kick  ass  or not  let s see  i m a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken  i ve got to start learning about grappling though  freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that kenny is a racist  here are some excerpts from users from other forums the armchair analyst asia times forum  i see  however  you sounded like a racist  no  i have no south asian sensitivities i am no nationalist jingoist  i consider myself above it all  all your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of greatness it may be in a narrow anglo saxon way  but not in a gandhi buddha sort of a way  get it civilizations such as india  actually even china until today  have never had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours you have generalized indians to be bigots etc i agree that some not all are  but the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as obnoxious by definition makes you a racist  yes it does  rocky asia times forum  what inaccuracy are you referring to  if brits came to india and got rich  was the wealth indian or british  besides looting  what exactly did british accomplish  while your bias is clearly visible with this statement  what is your purpose of posting this in this forum isnt it quiet evident that even in yr it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass  why on earth would anything written by anglo saxon when europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate  isnt there a vested interest on part of the european to disparage native cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements that s just a couple of the many others  however  i do not want to clog up this page i have also noticed that kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles  and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  i know that i am not the only one who knows this brahman martial arts planet forum i really do  hate  to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine  which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion  were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning  bliss asia times forum thats not from a  social studies journal  you fraud  thats a copy paste  rocky asia times forum i believe kenneth probably picked up a web site of some tourist board,0

 hm  i was actually writing a response as you sent yours  oh well  for the record  my response was this resurrecting articles is frowned upon  yes  we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one  however though of course we both know that there s no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted w hate ver we did there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches  changing the name would be nice but i m not sure what we would change to the game didn t really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such  and there are limited other ways of naming the article making this subpage was a decent idea  you just got unlucky in that it s something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against  honestly i can say i ve never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community wide shrugging of the shoulders  certainly there s been no afd nomination yet  which is a start  i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article  i e  not keeping the subpage  but i don t have strong feelings so i ll run with w hate ver works  if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like category football matches  i have no idea if that exists  it was another example  and category fa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own  that category would then have to be categorised so it wasn t just an orphan  i don t know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect it s not encouraged  so that idea might be rejected if  whoever did it  couldn t find more like minded articles to categorise into the same  i don t think it being categorised would really affect anyone s opinion of the article though  the one thing that might affect peoples  judgement right now is that it will  in its present form  show up in categories as manchester city fuck season spurs city or however the subpage is actually named  given the in the name yes  i d say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category  i don t know how long it would take for it to get sorted  but it would probably be put somewhere generic  better to do it ourselves  i guess sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came and well  better english just didn t quite flow from my fingers as i typed  hopefully i addressed all your points  i ll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it  though i think that page would be best served by being redone with as many citations as possible and expanded upon  so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society  so to speak  having an article afd ed isn t a permanent sign that that article should never exist  it s merely a suggestion that it shouldn t exist in the state it s in  generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and or level of detail is substantially improved as for the charity shield  i always considered it a notable trophy  yes  it s a single game  but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place  ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play to this end  i d consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it  similarly  would you question the worthiness of the european super cup  in fact  because some teams initially didn t enter  city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice  you could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it  we should be the ones most ardently defending it talk  ,0

 july utc although i understand your arguments  i am surprised you don t understand mine i don t find it labyrinthine  or at least not particularly so  not more than many other events and aspects concerning the beatles  nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure  since it can be taken from any number of texts on the beatles however  though i support the original author s intent here  i guess you and i are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now at some point  however  i will source his her statements  as soon as i find time to delve into the texts  just because i would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you until then  i don t think we will make much more progress on this  the problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth but to me  discrediting the original author s intent is like a dog biting its own tail from wikipedia  re  abbey road being the final album or not abbey road is the eleventh official album recorded by the beatles  although its release preceded that of let it be  it was the last album to be recorded after the near disastrous sessions for the proposed get back album  later retitled let it be for release paul mccartney suggested to producer george martin that the group get together and make an album just like the old days just like we used to  free of the conflict that began with the sessions for the white album  martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be  in their interviews for the beatles anthology series  the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final beatles  product  and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high note re  the position of the end the end was initially intended to be the final track on abbey road  but it is followed by her majesty in the first practice mix of the medley  constructed on july  her majesty followed mean mr  mustard etc this labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people ,0

 legislation  european union the atricle claims the european union has ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide both the holocaust and the armenian genocide the source reads the european union has just ratified a law banning incitement to or denial of genocide arguably including both the holocaust and the armenian genocide some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source  let s have a look at the law itself  framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia  official press release  certain forms of conduct as outlined below  which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose  are punishable as criminal offences public condoning  denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide as defined in the statute of the international criminal court  articles and and crimes defined in article of the charter of the international military tribunal  when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group  example  somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide  the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court  never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments  this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned  but would also incite hatred against this group  in the future  all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case  whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction  in the case of the holocaust  for example  this was done by the nuremberg tribunal as we see  the law is restricted to cases  when the commission of genocide is established by an international court and  the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred is the commission of armenian genocide established by an international court ,0

 utc as a close follower of the language political issues in finland  i have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongue s significance in defining what  if you will  we could call ethnic identity especially when it comes to finnish speakers  swedish speakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century  when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having two languages which from individual people s mother tongue point of view is patent nonsense  the mother tongue of  say  my entire family tree is finnish and what swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language  w hate ver happens in the future  our language policy has not yet managed to implant swedish as a general second language in the population  and this must be taken into account here  i can well understand how fenno swedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered finnish but there is always the flipside of such a coin august ,0

 hello deacon  thanks for the kind words  your wording is better regarding territory  but i think that it still might specifically mention the firth of clyde  since northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while how about between the humber and the firths of clyde and forth or similar  but there s no great preference here either way oswiu chose the roman way at whitby in and he died in thereafter there was a steady erosion of iona based clerics in northumbrian territory  quite noticeable by pehthelm s consecration in the  th century have a look at the skene reference i cite  which suggests that both picts and northumbrians were working in concert in the early  th century towards the roman way in preference to the columban way it looks like a political process  constant and steady  but not a sudden  forcible ouster the end result was indeed a facilitation of northumbrian hegemony  northumbria s fortunes were up and down in the  th century regarding its southern neighbors  particularly mercia  and that is not to suggest that anyone chose deiran preferences over bernician ones  i m aware of the substantial history of iona based clerics in bernicia  but times change  and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons the  trans lation of pehthelm s name without stated authority is indeed sourced the claim is made flat out  so have a look at the reference cited  i tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily indeed  you should be able to quickly access every citation that i made in the article  regards  ,0

 deletion of dave warwak page wondering why is was necessary to delete the page on dave warwak  an educator of vegan practices and animal rights  i see that your comment on the reason for deletion was the only thing he is known for is being fired however that is not the case in the animal friendly  vegetarian  vegan community  in fact he is praised by many for his passion in properly educating children about the origins of their food  why would you find it so crucial to speedy delete a page that simply speaks of cruelty free living  and aims to educate people on the truth about their food is that information threatening to wikipedia for some reason  and i wouldn t think as a wiki admin that your opinion on the topic is reason enough to control what info is available and what is deleted  you may know mr  warwak as only being fired  but being the intelligent science studying individual that you are  surly you must realize that his efforts to educate children and promote compassion for animals is actually very honorable and deserving of recognition  please show a little compassion yourself and undelete the page  ,0
troublesome sentence  paleolithic europeans seem to have been a homogenous population  possibly due to a population bottleneck  or near extinction event  on the iberian peninsula  where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation  and then expanded into europe during the mesolithic period  this is false  i cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that palaeolithic europe was genetically homogeneous  if there is one  it would require in line citation  i think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves  the studies have  rather  shown that mesolithic europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion  the bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently ,0

 i have to assume you have not been listening  and are just trolling now  let me try to educate you  per wp policy  on other talk pages  especially where such text is directed against you  removal should typically be limited to clear cut cases where it is obvious the text is a true personal attack  shouldn t admins know this for my part  i might ask the user who made a certain comment i dislike  in extreme situations  to retract it  but at least i ask the opinion of others first on whether that comment really is a personal attack to just go to someone else s talk page and delete comments you don t like is intrusive  bad mannered and  abusive  i have never done that  and never will  and i say this having been the target of actual personal attacks myself  please go troll somewhere else  ,0

 i m not even sure what you mean when you stated  just trying to help make you piece sound better do you mean your piece if so  this isn t my piece  it s an article written from the contribution of many editors  i did not author the sentence you are trying to modify  secondly  you didn t just change a phrase  you added leading to terminus which was part of my reason for reverting  if you read the entire sentence  it s somewhat redundant to add that  and finally  there s nothing unprofessional about the term railroad  in fact  it s actually a better fit  if you look up the definition for railway  you ll find that it s often used to describe a type of railroad that operates over short distances  we have no idea if that s true or not  and therefore  railroad is actually preferred  ,0

 european borders there is a big problem going on about whether republic of georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in europe or not  as you know there is no official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions  so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page  well sadly thats not what most editors think  they put one version there and every time i changed it  it went back to the previous version  now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me  they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why  it is unacceptable  i contacted one of the editors and he she said that he chose that version because he she thinks it is the most neutral one i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible  they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border council of europe  the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european country is in the middle of the nato membership process  only european countries are eligible for it according  to the north atlantic treaty  and they are not even mentioning why they left it out  turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato  cant they understand that page is not about the eu  its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be included  i really want to ask someone to take care of it as they dont seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages  ,0

 a poor start  sorry  the author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table  first of all  no common two nations table is possible  patent nonsense second  i object the following  the passage from the russian table speaking of the kievan rus  as someone suggested earlier  that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between kievan rus and modern russia  this is the main disputed claim  commented enough in other articles unacceptable for me and several other ukrainian and belarusian users regardless of any ukrainian military table  none of them may include the red army  this army was not only irrelevant to any of ukrainian states  with very formal post wwii exception but also significantly anti ukrainian  for instance  red army units widely participated in war crimes against ukrainian population and anti soviet guerillas  creation of the ukrainian table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all ukrainian users  for instance  see earlier alexpu s passage on trading the truth given all that  i d suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising  mr buckshot  i thank you  an innocent editor  for your valuable attempts and hope for further cooperation on the issue  ,0
 an admittedly biased source  but with more or less first hand information  is the chabad group which just smuggled  or at least claims to have  matzoh from  the  ukraine to iran for the passover holiday  the news article states that members of the chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into iran last week in order to enable local jew s in the islamic republic to celebrate the passover  according to tradition  some jew s currently live in iran  the authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion  but forbid the import of israel made products to the country  an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years  while they probably didn t get an exact census of the people they were delivering to  i d guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct  so seems to be the way to go  ,0

 more description of location please hello  i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence  maybe in the description section  to explain where this bridge is  i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you don t already know stockton well  or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful  i was wondering if you could write a more bottom up description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah  or near blah street etc it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or w hate ver  which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms  what do you think  any yes  of course the maps link does nail it  assuming the co ordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would  i think  be very useful  i may be being unusually thick happens all the time  actually  but on my first reading and i was last in stockton in you see i was not at all sure where it was  wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre  i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps  yes  but the sentence i m asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg  go on  please write it for me  you know you want to  and i will go and put the kettle on for you  thanks and best wishes ,0

automatic protection for main page  it would be straightforward to write a bot that protected all images on the main page  adding template mprotected  and unprotected all images with template mprotected that no longer appeared on the main page  feature would be genuinely useful and save editors work  however  if editors came to rely on feature then that would introduce a risk  because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it  a clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap  and worse  the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image  i suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become may utc ,0

 changes to this page open discussion since my first contribution over two months ago  i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page  after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a d  menagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris  i was met with opposition over a link and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the page s contibutors  i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling my goal here is not to control anything  as was complained to one of the administrators i would like only to contribute to making a better page  i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history namely those concerning the french kings but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement  so i had little to do there  this page  on the other hand  i find lacking  and see many things that could be improved the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information far too much for a general paris page  the search function is a very important element of wikipedia  and with this in mind  much on this page is redundant and unneccessary  those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window  the same for paris history or paris fashion here i am but repeating what i have already written below in short  in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris  or one totally ignorant on the subject in other words  one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages  my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information  but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own  this would even be a positive move  as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page the irony of the sort is that  though i contribute to wiki  it won t be to this page in any quantity  my specialty is the history of paris  and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here paris  history has a page of its own  just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information  i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement please answer with any ideas you would have  with this post i would also like to sound the board to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page  as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt  in your answers  i hope for evidence to the contrary  please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all  addendum you can find a proposition for restructuring here please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes  i don t really want to cut everthing out  ,0
 after studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in the anglo irish physicist g  johnstone stoney suggested that there existed a single definite quantity of electricity  he was able to estimate the value of the charge e of a monovalent ion by means of faraday s laws of electrolysis this means that chemistry is part of the definitio if the electron  the value of charge  was equated to faradays laws of electrolysis  there should be an section in the electron article on chemistry and if your going to mention obscure virtual electrons why not mention chrystal fields  because that is fundamental to chemistry if your going to mention quantum physics  why cant you mention quantum chemsitry  because i think chemistry is just as important to physics if not more important and i think there should be a section on electrolysis  ,0

official christian death this page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish  which simply need changing and then leaving alone i have now prepared an unbiased wiki article which i wish to place on here  knowing full well that minutes later  the fools that wish to write things they know little about  or have a vested interest in making it appear that facts can be altered to suit their own quest to become cd  will desperately alter the content  the article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts people that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them but the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow rd party discussion regarding valor or rozz should be eliminated in favour of the christian death biography message me at myspace com official christian death to have discussion about page article i propose is thus  text only i will alter the page to format correctly  and alter the main page  add feedback to this after my discussion in thread called editing talk christian death comment not inside this christian death  biography discography in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  then christian death turned it upside down history officially there have been over musicians involved with the band  therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical formed in los angeles and fronted by year old vocalist lyricist rozz williams  the band released the first album only theatre of pain in a dark  sinister style of punk rock  the album gained local success  a year later the band completely broke up  singer rozz then joined the band pompeii founded by singer  guitarist  song writer valor  rozz took over vocals leaving valor to focus on guitar  before rozz joined pompeii the band had already released their fist album look at yourself to much acclaim  which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor  the pompeii had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their french record company  to merge pompeii into a new version of christian death which after some debate was agreed upon  thus  began the new christian death and the first pompeii tour became the first christian death tour part way through the tour the band stopped in wales to record songs  some of which were originally intended for the next pompeii album  the fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic catastrophe ballet like the first pompeii album  catastrophe ballet had an apocalyptic theme  however the music morphed into something not quite pompeii and nothing like the first christian death album  after the tour the band returned to la to later record the  rd christian death album ashes which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future  after confirming the  nd tour in singer rozz quit the band  valor returned to vocals  the band embarked on the  nd tour  in italy the band recorded the mini album the wind kissed pictures a surrealist view of a mystical past  almost immediately work began on the  th full length album atrocities inspired by the atrocities of world war ii and the connection to future shock waves  while continuously touring in the band released the  th and now classic album the scriptures the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today brought us the release of sex drugs jesus christ this was turning point for the band  the cover depicted an image of jesus shooting up heroin  this was a full frontal attack by valor against the church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized christianity  the band then found themselves confronted by protesters  riots and bomb threats  these events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of nine inch nails  korn  marilyn manson  type o negative  every goth band on the planet and many others saw the release of the double album epic all the love  all the  hate  interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death  day and night  man and woman  black and white in came the release of insanus  ultio  proditio  misericordiaque with its theme of an ancient dream state late in after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting christian death  rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in los angels under the name christian death  on the same day christian death was in europe performing in paris  france  assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash  as explained to valor,0

the very long discussion over st wp scn project talk page i have read a lot of the wp scn pages  and the very few have neutrality tags  some have or tags but the majority seem to be npov  so why is the project talk page being bloated by a discussion between three scientologists  from what i can make out have scanned all three user pages  and a lot of comments are unsigned  about how the project is biased against elron  would the time not be better used by going through the pages and challenging npov  possibly by throwing in neutrality tags and pointing out non npov statements on the talk pages of those articles  after all xenu is fa status so the npov cannot be too far off  as for unsigned  the comment you left after my first post was unsigned  and there were a couple of more during the discussion ,0
actually  yes  that s what i m saying  the protection should only have a time out function to resolve pending edits on the talk page  if the current revision is the cause of the problem  you should first revert to a previous one before protecting the page  but no more than that  that you find this funny indicates that you seriously overestimate the range of sysop responsibilities ,0

  nor have i made a legal threat first  i am not among those three people who participated in that visit to the blm protest i have never known any of these people i would not be the offended party  in any case i ve never even lived in minnesota  or been there in over years or so  i made an airplane connection through minneapolis in about as i vaguely recall  i am not saying there will be any sort of legal proceeding  i am merely saying that to cite this claim heard the n word risks running afoul of being libel i think wp rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody heard the n word is problematic from a wp blp standpoint if multiple blm protestors claim that they heard one of the  white  visitors say the n word  and it was cited from some reliable source  that would probably change my opinion can you see why this would be a different situation ,0

  i m in twothree minds over this proposal  as regards redlinks  on the one hand  over the last two years of monitoring the topic  i ve seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles  on the other hand  it is arguable that a death reported in a wp rs is of a person of some note  if not necessarily within our standards  on the third hand  we do get some no hopers on the face of it  which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article  and then delete undeveloped entries as non notable  in the second case  we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability  because it may be that interested editors are lacking  that s why the month moratorium seems to exist  as far as i can tell  andemu  ,0

 parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know better  dear impartial but not disinteresed reader  coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing she is of the firm  resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for section at the bottom of the page  but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section she has declined the opportunity to amend  leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever so gently against my back  with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is  in her god like view  soap like not the most pleasant position to be in  i can assure you to use another example  picked completely at random  let s say there s been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over  say  fractional reserve banking  and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in then let s say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in my humble view slaughtered version is that soapboxing to use another example  closer to home let s say a guy like zenwhat says to his co conspirators  what can we do to have our version of debt based monetary system fractional reserve banking prevail like he clearly said here under the  desperate heading help and then he also  bizarrely asks gregalton help him delete references to mises org like he did here  saying to gregalton also  in case you re interested  one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to mises org as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism  can you believe it i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll  he also says to his co conspirator the following  on the same page i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized  it made me realize that we re going around in circles  we improve the articles to the point that they look great  then they get screwed up again  so  i had an idea  would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery it could help people who aren t educated the idea is for it to be straightforward  with references  but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery  clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that don t agree with his  the guy is mad if the guy had napalm or nukes he d use them without hesitation  then  for good measure  he goes back to debt based monetary system to do more editing zenwhat is clearly a piece of work check out the dude s talk page in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with mises org  his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana so  i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking what a combo seeing this  i ponder my options i decide to post a note here  on my own talk page  asking readers to compare older  better versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for as a gift to the  eight people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page  it immediately gets deleted by all seeing  all knowing coren as soapboxing is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wp style fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will  but don t bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines this is like watching evolution in reverse i carefully construct a page with the help of others it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school  who knows what motivates these sickos instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiot  s  i ask t,0

 frankly this is a waste of everybody s time it serves no purpose to repeat the arguments against inclusion over again  full in the knowledge that you will not accept them your spiels of wikilawyering have demonstrated very little on the whole you have consistently failed to assume good faith  and you have not convinced anyone that your biased original research belongs in the article you claimed that four days ago you did not know what a talk page was yet  you are now lecturing users who are far more experienced than you in these matters on your beliefs on wiki policy we haven t moved on significantly if you cannot accept that on controversial articles the standard of challenged  or likely to be challenged is higher than elsewhere  then you are in no position be lecturing policy to us wp ucs is a guide an essay  not policy in any case  common sense dictates that on controversial articles  material is more likely to be challenged than on non controversial ones this is challenged material and you require a better cite than the ones you gave us the material has implications for npov these are the facts that are relevant here a long circular argument on talk helps no one  talk  ,0

 just to make the point that i m not making this problem up  here s the abstract of http findarticles com p articles mi hb is  ai n who are the canadians changing census responses canadian ethnic studies journal spring by monica boyd doug norris at the close of the twentieth century  canadian has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group  up from percent in to nearly percent in and to percent in the census of canada  from what groups did this indigenous label draw in the five years between the and the censuses  using unpublished tabulations from the and canadian censuses  this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the canadian born age in and age by we find that most of the increases between and in canadian ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in british origin responses  between and increasing canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the british and french ethnic origin counts  in some provinces  notably the prairie provinces of alberta  manitoba  and saskatchewan  shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups  ,0

 talk ramon berenguer i  count of barcelona talk ramon berenguer i  count of barcelona might interest you  peter i of aragon what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of peter over a contemporary coin  your edits are predominantly changes to lead images  yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them  you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not  the reasons to prefer the coin are  it is a contemporary artefact  giving information about peter s reign  w  a caption  and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime the coin does not mislead readers about the times of peter i  as the portrait might the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low resolution jpg format it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate  clean shaven and long haired  than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later  it gives us no information about peter or his reign  its sole purpose was decorative what makes the coin an image of peter is that that is when it was struck and what for  but what makes the later portrait an image of peter is that somebody labelled it that way they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese king  in your last edit summary  you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations  i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer  srnec  the problem is that we have different criteria you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived  i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person  the article is to the information i think that a portrait  even if wasn t painted during the live of the person  is most valid that a little image carved in a coin  the two representations have the same chance of not being accurate  but at least one illustrates better than the other if not exist any portrait of this person  then i accept a coin s image or a poor drawing  but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time  i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you ve just asserted the contrary  do you have an argument  why are your criteria better than mine really  when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page  i stated my reasons  but i do not want another long discussion with you  i offer consensus  would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century both of those are improvements over the th century image  but not over the coin  at least one other editor agrees with me  sorry i m not agree with your second comment  but i hope we have made a step in the right direction  this discussion is already too long  both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character s life  either both seem right  imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia i noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think  you are not allowed to impose your will  both pedro i of brazil and pedro ii of brazil are featured articles  they were reviewed by several editors  stop with your edit warring  lecen is aware of the three revert rule  are you  you ve reverted four times on both pedro i and pedro ii in the last hours  you should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution  such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment ,0

regarding az helping ahmed ressam get to canada  my reading of his csr  trans cript is exactly the opposite he asked ahmed ressam if he could get him five  stolen canadian passports  because he was tired of being a stateless person in pakistan regarding whether az ran the khaldan camp  didn t he testify that he hadn t paid a visit to khaldan for years i thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp s management team but  if the camp had been a college i think his role s  would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer a registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order  and officially informs them that they have been admitted az ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training and  once they finished their training  he helped those who wanted to go fight in chechnya or israel to slip into those conflict zones he had helped grads slip into bosnia  during the civil war there  i think it would have been more accurate to say ibn al shaykh al libi ran the camp his location was a secret for four years he was found in a libyan prinson in april  by human rights workers  who conducted an initial interview with him and a few weeks later the libyans reported he committed suicide i really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version  his pre torture versions  of what the camp did ,0
  as i suspected  complete nonsense  your statement is so silly that i can t begin to tell you how wrong it is  you said  you there presume that your not yet filed arbcom case has been decided i assure you that this was not the case i would consider that to be a stupid assumption  i am not a stupid person  i would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part  and withdraw everything on this page based on your mind reading trick  you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability comment by the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me  your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack  if it wasn t so silly i would spend time thinking more on it  which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack  here s a few points for you to think on wp civil  wp agf wp npa  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles  then let s consider the arbcom an article  what then is this articles content  hmm  let s see the arbcom is an article  so what is the arbcom made of  why  members  so that means the content of the committee is it s members  so an election is a decision on the content of this article  so  members are editors  so content is editors  so in order to write this article we must discuss the content  we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content  you don t like that  wp civil  wp agf wp npa  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles  but arbcom is not an article  it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee  we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee  we cannot question articles about their content  nor can we ask the content questions  but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions  is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership  if you do not think so  how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid  would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder  if there is evidence  a diff  of intellectual failings  does the candidate realise this failing  can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing  the questions were politely put  they were challenging  and they were meant to be  and anyone in the community  which includes me  has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance  there was no name calling  all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom  they were not deferential  which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed  your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully  do not try to bully me  finally i would contrast the participation of admin s in this ani with the marshalling of forces which you participated in  and then came here  ,0
what do you consider primary sources in this context she notes the obvious homoerotic passages in rydberg s poetry and fiction  which are primary sources for literary criticism the details of rydberg s  sex ly troubled childhood and his uneasy relationship with women were presumably taken from his standard biographical sources i have no idea what sources svanberg and stolpe used  i can t ask them again  no other scholar has questioned the accuracy of their conclusions  which seems to me to be the definition of a scholarly consensus ,0

 i am not sure if i understand your reply above correctly unsd uses the term statistics divisions i agree  but the term refers to division s  in the un headquarter or agencies in different countries  not a specific way of geographic divisions of the world  you still prefer previous title  i e  united nations statistical divisions to the current one  i e  united nations geoscheme if so  please allow me to repeat a bit on the following the term statistics division capitalized singular form  in the un context refers to the organization of united nations statistics division with the website at unstats un org the term statistical divisions plural form  can mean any categorization schemes  not just geographical ones  google this statistical divisions site un org  the term statistical divisions plural form  can also mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments google this statistical divisions site un org therefore  it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term statistical divisions or the wrong organization term statistics division to refer to un m un statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the un system  or imply that there are certain un statistical categorization schemes in a general sense  not geographical i agree that un geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and also mapping  natural earth has region un and subregion metadata for each country  i use it quiet often  it is why i notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization classification scheme as un geoscheme try google book search and you will find at least the following the best option to identify the states from asia could be use the united nations  un  geoscheme for asia  as per this  asia is subdivided to four broad categories the un geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland north america south of the united states  conversely  the european union excludes belize and mexico from its definition of the region country groups are based on un geoscheme and world bank regional classification were grouped into regions and subregions based on the united nations geoscheme  http unstats un org  unsd methods m m  regin htm that the united nations statistics division would later classify as eastern asia  southern asia and southeastern asia according to its geoscheme  in fact i also agree that many un agencies  in fact  many other reports  consultancies  etc  have different statistical divisions in the general sense of categorization schemes  for research  this is exactly why i believe the term un geoscheme is better  although it is not official term or a technical term  un m i have not yet found an ambigous use of the term  correct me if i am wrong on this  so far every online and academic citations that i have found when the term un geoscheme is used  it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in un m moving forwards  since don t have the time nor will to take it to rm  and if you do not have any further couter evidence or  arguments with the evidence and claims that i layed out above  i can help by making the necessary editing without going to rm  of course  if you still have lingering concerns  please summarize your current arguments  preferrably after considering the evidence that i have already presented  and new evidence citations here  before i bring it to rm comparingchinese wikipedia vs baidu baike by hanteng ,0

 re dennis brown s final warning i didn t mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant  i didn t violate the final warning  curtisnaito did  multiple times the exact wording of the warning was if either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility  bludgeons a discussion  violates wp idht  acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page  or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors  then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of hours  at no point did i push the boundaries of civility  bludgeon a discussion  violate idht  act in a disruptive manner on any talk page  or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors  curtisnaito displayed the exact same kind of idht behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions  and when told explicitly that he was violating dennis brown s final warning  he kept doing it your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual  when nothing i had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning  was an off topic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened i understand you don t like me  but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users  talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly ,0

gothic metal and death rock nice call on the removing of metal traces in the death rock article  im having similar problems with the gothic metal article on people with little to no knowledge of the subjects editing the article and trying to draw an association between goth music and gothic metal when there isnt one  perhaps the death rock and gothic rock articles could do with a bit of an overhaul  ive seen that youve edited the death rock article quite a bit  so i assume you know a lot about the subject i suggest  if your willing to listen  that you read the gothic metal article  firstly so you better understand what it is  and secondly so you can work better with it  and its contents  on drawing the big black line  or pink if you prefer  that divides the two by a long way i call out to you as a fellow editor of articles  simply because i do not know enough about goth rock or death rock to compently edit them  mainly due to my work and association in the metal scene  this im sure we can build some form of a bridge  even if that bridge is to eleborate on the seperation of the two cultures ,0

fk vardar fk vardar is a macedonian football club  the club changed its name several times during its history  from original vardar in to citizens football club vardar or just citizens  gragjanski in macedonian in then football club makedonija in and finally back to fc vardar in by the name fc citizens  vardar the club won championships from till about yugoslavia  you have to know that yugoslavia was a federation of republics  countries together and each republic had its own championship  and there was a federal league where teams from the republics competed together  each republic had its own cup and the cup winners competed in the marshals cup  that cup was held in honor of joseph broz the marshal of the federation  and its was called the cup of the marshal  how ever fc vardar never won the federal league league made of federation of republics best teams  thats why its called the federal league  and not yugoslavian league nor yugoslavian cup the title in was won by fc partizan belgrade you can check in any official statistics or documents  the second federal league was made of two second federal leagues east republics competed  serbia  monte negro macedonia and two provinces  almost the same as republics but yet without a nation  those were kosovo and vojvodinship and west republics  croatia  bosnia and slovenia  sometimes clubs from province vojvodinship  would compete in the west depending on the federation decisions in the period of till present day republic of macedonia was established as provinces within the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes  those provinces were skopje  bitola shtip and vranje prvinces  these provinces established the macedonian football federation in and they held championships  in these provinces joined in one duchy and this championship was held in the duchy banovina for times during the ww  the championship was held under german occupation  and the german government recognized this league  after the ww  the very same championship was tranformed in to republic football league  just the province of vranje was separated from the republic as macedonia  trans formed from duchy to a republic and the province of vranje was under the newly made republic of serbia in the bottom line is since the federation of republics split in the s  macedonian republic league was  trans formed in to macedonian first league  so it is the same league that changed names and competition format during the decades  and now it came to this level  its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the macedonia and other republics in the federation by the serbian side  serbian official politic is to show that yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football  they are trying to show the world that there was yugoslav nation serb and only yugoslav football league serb league denying the federal league second federal league and republic leagues  they want to show only yugoslav league and not the real federal league  they hold all the champions from the federal league as serbian champions in every competition  for fc vardar at this point of view considering that  macedonia is not in the federetion for more than years and it wont be in the future  the most important are the titles and trophies won in the macedonian league and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the federation  the period before you should write the precise information  second federal league east is the name of the competition  and you should put the macedonian flag from that period of the time next to it instead of the federal flag  simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation  about the cup you should write down the real proper name as it was called  marshals cup also fallowed by macedonian flag from that period of the time  you should put a notice that in the federal second league east clubs from serbia macedonia and monte negro competed including the provinces of kosovo i vojvodinship ,0

self published and questionable sources about themselves  an important lesson from wikipedia  and i quote self published and questionable sources may only be used as sources about themselves  and only if the material used is relevant to the notability of the subject being discussed it is not contentious it is not unduly self serving it does not involve claims about third parties it does not involve claims about events not directly related to the subject there is no reasonable doubt as to who authored it the article is not based primarily on such sources emphasis mine  tiger by the tail ,0

 hello barto  i am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the ron gostick page and are you the creator of it as stated on the talk page there  you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left these are terms both i and ron  himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the canadian league of rights  i could explain why here  but i won t bore you with the details however  i do reject the notion that everything must link to a wiki article i am editing at another page  where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy  i will not object to so called left or right sources  as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to mr  gostick the archives at the australian league of rights will have plenty of published materials on him  league objectives and views or anyone associated with him  this is one link that was removed in favor of david lethbridge s document  hardly a non politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what gostick and the league of rights stood for i will try to help you find sources  fair and credible in the near future  doing edits myself i just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him i know well what he and the league of rights stand for  as i have been involved with it for near yrs  there is no denying he was anti totalitarianism and that includes anti zionist  which automatically brings down the bogus smear of anti semitism  and other such nonsense an editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about i have notified paul fromm of the wiki page and link to him at gostick s page  in case he didn t know it existed be aware that wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons  edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later one was a recent high level member of the kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it living or dead  i don t care to see this happen to anyone  feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish do you have a wiki email or a private one ,0

 football player statistics hi nathanco and thanks for your message  of course the information you ve been adding to footballers  pages is accurate  but here at wikipedia there is a convention to summarise league competition only in the infobox  where you see it at the top while cups and european competitions are generally displayed much further down the page  no one is suggesting you are adding bad data  but please bear the above in mind when making future edits  thanks a lot for your contributions so far  and we look forward to seeing many more of them ,0

hey  it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism  but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner  you have to change this attitude on your part  your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus  even if it is demonstrably wrong  in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says  you guys are of course wrong  you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism  that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated  every day i find  dumb  stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia  i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine  your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia  i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason  it is just plain innacurate ,0

for the record  i was serious about running in the rfa i was not trolling or disrupting  i was advised that i should run in the rfa to see how it was like  and i did so there should have been more questions during the rfa if there was any questions about sincerity the rfa was not a joke  it was serious i feel i should have been made an admin and then would have been the better example  i felt that there was a possibility for confirmation and this should serve as example for other users to be afraid of self nominations to the rfa  even when there is clearly a poll support for running in the rfa as i am truely afraid  shocked and dismayed at the admins response  as it seems now there is a new rule  if the admin feel you are faking your rfa  they can block you with zero assumptions of good faith ,0

 first  if you create obviously bogus claims  nobody needs to waste his time refuting the claim as applied to each excerpt you cut and paste one refutation is more than sufficient second  your rationales appear to be shifting originally you claimed that the article contained creative facts and pov statements now you claim that a particular statement is unverifiable be very specific about what you find problematic citing the specific wikipedia policy  given your contentious history with this article  dating back over a year  it is evident that your goal is to portray the exile as an uncredible source i believe you will reject any claims that undermine this premise  regardless of their consistency with wikipedia policy consequently  if you want to be taken seriously  you need act cooperatively to resolve issues this means being specific in your complaints  citing the exact policy this means no specious claims and this means accepting the article as undisputed if you don t have any specific issues can you abide by these conditions ,0

 it s a stupid project wikipedia should be a hub of information for all ages  if it is filled up with porno articles with inappropriate material  both encyclopedic and for the reading of the general population  child or otherwise  then it is restricting the audience of wikipedia surely  i mean how can a source of information be free and accessible to all  if it is ostensibly linked with explicit material  most of which shouldn t be in the encyclopedia ps i know about wikipedia s no censorship issue but sometimes it goes too far  ,0

 deindent  sorry for kibitzing  but i wanted to be fair to all points of view  even those of the dualists  so i tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions the thought experiment is this you have one observer  the observer gets cloned into copy and copy either hubert yorick or star trek style the copies diverge  either because of internal noise  or because of the environment  from a third person point of view  this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system  there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on  one observer becomes two  if probed  each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event  but viewed from the inside  if you are the observer getting cloned  there is a very natural question you can ask  am i going to end up being copy or am i going to be copy this question cannot even be formulated from the outside  so it has no objective answer  but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer this scenario is dennett s  and to some extent everett s since the question doesn t even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective  the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms  you might conclude that this question doesn t make any sense  but  in any case  the answer to this question is bit of subjective information which both copy and copy know  and which the original observer does not  in the objective third person view  there is no information gained  you know that copy will say i am copy and copy will say i am copy to give an example of actual or and synth  i ll go beyond dennett s example  suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely  so that the cloning keeps happening again and again  then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer  from the first person perspective  for example  take a star trek duplicator  and duplicate the observer  and then duplicate each duplicate  but add a twist  the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks  and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later  and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way  and then it does so again forty years later  then sixty years later  what is the subjective experience  from a naive counting perspective  i should predict that i would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point  because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies  on the other hand  the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates  so perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice  rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state  even worse  how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator boltzmann s brain is a similar idea ,0
it is absurd for you to call this disruption  this is an attempt at serious discussion  i previously posted it on her talk page but she deleted it there  where else am i supposed to post a concern i have about someone s conduct  the length of the post is a measure of the seriousness with which i approach this  rather than simply brushing it aside  i would appreciate you or anyone else responding to my points about her comments on sourcing  verifiability  etc ,0

 october utc  this is a non trivial problem  many perhaps most of the editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits  i can think of two fa writers in that group  one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits  another spends a lot of time on awb  any analysis of those would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types  then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits  and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed  but most importantly  the accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active spielchequers ,0

yes you got it the govt lied see the talk page for cselr  ok  i m lazy and not typing current page name they provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from i have provided the link to the index of papers produced  mainly email acceptances rejections of meeting appointments btw  so you can confirm that the business case was never provided there are no source documents for any figure contained in the business case summary some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and post tfnsw publications  such as with the capacity claimed by gb on the mr for the modification approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are lower i am one of community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about that is why i have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language the minutes for the community rep meeting with tfnsw are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions the terms of reference  open to the public to see  for the community rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet tfnsw are refusing to do this i have since discovered that of the community reps are current employees of the state govt and is a past  self proclaimed  senior executive of tfnsw so not only do they not tell the truth they have also stacked the community reference group http w parliament nsw gov au prod lc lctabdoc nsf c c b b ca ee a e b  f c fca cee c  a opendocument highlight light  rail  link to index of docs produced for  st call that is why there was the  nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the upper house mps to publicly state the govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the  confidential boxes that the mps could not talk about after looking at by making the  nd call for papers stating the docs not provided in the  st call they made it public the outcome they expected was what ended up happening ,0

i disagree  the fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance  the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy  parliamentary system  that allows for both coalitions and majority rule  that hasn t changed  and so to say that because we currently have a coalition  of w hate ver party  means that the position of deputy prime minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false  i am all for mentioning nick clegg as deputy prime minister in the article  around the same place david cameron is currently described as prime minister  but to put clegg alongside the queen and prime minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right  now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the prime minister s second in command  and if cameron were to die resign suddenly clegg would become prime minister  i would completely agree that he should be there  but it isn t  clegg may be deputy prime minister  but he is not deputy head of government  and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government ,0

 thank you for pointing out that anne of widnica  wikipedia  wiki has only hits  not as many web pages mirror wikipedia content  and not all pages acknowledge that  allowing the further propagation of such or terms is clearly unacceptable when looking at google scholar anne of swidnica has at least one hit  compared to none for the diacritic version or the polish name and that refers to the book medieval germany  an encyclopedia already mentioned above  which on page uses  inconsistent naming by two different authors  while elsewhere preferring schweidnitz  google scholar  with hits for anna von schweidnitz shows that this is the proper name used internationally by scholars  discu ,0

 dubious claims about clearly non  trans genderd people this article lists a whole bunch of people whos  trans gender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative this isn t a list of people who kinda  sorta  there s a small chance  maybe are  trans gender the ones who cross dressed for some nefarious deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as  trans gender and should be removed from the article completely the fact that mythological figures such as achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the pov pushing of the people who supported it the only mythological one who might be considered  trans genderes is guan yin the real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something  e g  military service  or even to get into something where women are discriminated against they did it for deceptive purposes as well  so they can t really be considered  trans gendered the pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed the one about joan of arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source if they accused her of being a witch  should we have included her in a list of witches too also  i d like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it s most wikipedia ripped sites and lgbt websites that site that as fact and what are  trans vestite tendencies in reference to ed wood you need to start citing sources or i m just going to start deleting them that goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section maxwell klinger wasn t even a real  trans vestite  he only did that so he d get a section and get kicked out of the army anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill this phrase describing the character is also very odd although a  trans vestite  he loudly denied any charges of homo sex ity  what s the association between the two also  it appears they re using a warped definition of  trans gender here i ve never heard a definition that would automatically include cross dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes i m sorry  but this overly broad and incorrect definition of  trans gender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible june utc  ,0

 street gang mr  davis thanks for your note on my talk page  i really appreciate it  and it s an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book as this article s creator and main editor  i m sorry that you thought the review section was so negative please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that i was in any way trying to disparage your book in my rush to get the article published  i did a google search and those are the reviews i found also please understand that this is a wikipedia article  and the article as it now stands will never be complete it s a work in progress i thought an article about street gang was important enough to get out there i am by no means a professional writer  so i m certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it  so i depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors i would ve thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work i appreciate your feedback  something i always welcome as a wikipedia editor if you are aware of other sources that i wasn t able to locate  please send them my way  on my talk page i ll repeat this message via your webpage  to ensure that you see it you should also know that i ve taken it upon myself to improve all sesame street related articles on wikipedia it s a big project  and a great need for example  sesame street  at one point was actually a featured article  but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons it s an unfortunate state at the current time your book came out shortly after i took on the project  so it s been a boom for me i thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start  so your book has been a valuable resource i ve already started working on this article  history of sesame street  and if you look at the reference section  you ll see that i ve used your book extensively it s also a work in progess  and no where near finished my goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by sesame street s th anniversary in november i can t tell you how much your book has helped me on a personal level  i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed your book it was a fun read  and immensely interesting i was brought to tears many times  especially when i realized while reading about all that joan cooney and her team did to get the show on the air see  i m turning this year  which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it i had to put the book down to compose myself when i realized  they did all that for me  i appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly  and now the life of my own children  who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as i did and still do i believe that sesame street deserves high quality articles on wikipedia  and i ve taken it upon myself to help accomplish that if you  as the ultimate expert  could assist me in that goal  i can t tell you how valuable that would be again  thanks for the feedback and communication  ,0

 you claim  yet again  that the text for example india based iyogi was reported by infoworld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software is not supported by the sources  this is incorrect  as both sources support both these assertions  brian krebs  a former washington post writer who now operates his own blog  krebs on security  tested iyogi himself and discovered that the company was indeed using scare tactics to coerce users into signing up then immediately went into my control panel and deleted what  iyogi  put on my computer and iyogi was using support calls to aggressively sell annual subscriptions proceeded to install an iyogi tune up tool called pcdiagnostics it took less than seconds to find this information in the sources provided  and yes  it is absolutely appropriate to include sourced information in wikipedia articles even if it happens to be negative for a certain company  contributions talk  ,0
jung and einstein in albert einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in aarau  switzerland  in after school in switzerland  einstein renounced his german citizenship  carl p  jung was born in in the swiss canton  or county  of thurgau  while jung worked on wandlungen und symbole der libido  psychology of the unconscious tensions grew between freud and jung  frank p  geyer continued to serve as a detective until august when he resigned  he had been  trans ferred to the th police district in the united states  detective geyer had arrested james anderson  whether this is the same anderson mentioned in detective geyer s work is non determinable  in tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak  in albert einstein acquired swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper  obtaining a teaching position at school in schaffhausen  switzerland  the fbi file on einstein came to light in when robert alan schwartz wrote an article on the subject for the nation magazine  between j  edgar hoover and john hutchison  democratic rights didn t stop with mccarthy s downfall nor with the demise of so called notorious j  edgar hoover  yet for years  zero point energy according to hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum  hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage  john hutchison s claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are  like  nasa  the fbi should do an article on nasa and their non determinable webers i do not find it too surprising schwartz once more wrote about not only frank geyer  but albert einstein with not too much said about carl p  jung during these years around the turn of the centennial ,0
 msa garratts hi the idea about an article is a good one  but unfortunately you ve started out with an error  that is understandable as the subject is complex  the wagr first imported the m class garratts  in these are very important locos  because they are the third class of garratt to be built  and the first main line garratt  showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler  they were followed up in by the ms class  only difference being the ms class were superheated  so they were also the first class of garratts to be the subject of a repeat order  both classes were built by beyer peacock the msa class were constructed in by the wagr in their own workshops  apparently a copy of the ms class  they did seem to have some cosmetic differences the story does not end there  but moves to victoria  the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class  the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge  outside framed garratts are very rare  even in the smaller gauges  but wait there is more  no  not steak knives the design was used again  for the australian portland cement s line near geelong  the first loco being supplied in and the second in the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of years  used on three railway  on two gauges and built by two manufacturers  with  if i ve added it up correctly locos constructed personally i think the article should cover the history of the design  and include all the varients  some work would be required to hunt down variations  though  so yes  i think it does deserve an article please feel free to use the above if you wish cheers michael  ,0

 controversy your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip in actuality  it is the firearm experts that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology in other words  because they have taken issue with the layman s wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around so while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy  m w dictionary when i say the dictionary clearly i m referring to the dictionary i cited before in this case m w i am a cognitive miser like anyone that takes short cuts when i can  just as you shortened it to m w rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means i agree the dictionary isn t for giving an exhaustive description  that s what encyclopedias are for however in this instance it does shed some light on the controversy as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine the reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines the purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within wikipedia this is entirely acceptable  agreement  clearly some people don t agree with m w just as you and i don t agree with saami s statement that people sometimes refer to cartridge clips as magazines the experts on weapon s have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to magazines as clips just because you and i disagree with saami s statement doesn t mean it should be taken out as a reference and i d never suggest that what i suggest is a compromise i agree with you about the references regarding remington and marlin as that does seem to fall under or m w however doesn t fall under or as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated without saying it s wrong because it clearly isn t according to common usage i m thinking something like this clip technically defined use to describe magazine is controversial however m w defines it as such this allows readers to see their is a difference in terms  there is a controversy  and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated i think this is fair note well that i never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what you re saying here i m not interested in destroying your view  only presenting both sides fairly  ,0

possible images so i just removed a huge mate  ad from the article  because in my opinion  although i believe it was added in good faith by user krw it s inappropriate for an article about a general product or service to feature prominently the advertising or image of one single product within the class  some examples i looked at included soft drink where the main picture shows a variety of brands on a supermarket shelf  with a photo of the diet pepsi product line much lower down potato chip where two of the three pictures are of chips without packaging  and the third is a non current ad  fast food where all of the food is shown unwrapped  and only the big mac is clearly identifiable plus a nondescript interior photo and a photo of several adjacent restaurants  chocolate bar with an unwrapped chocolate bar shown this brings up a quandry  what do we use for images  my best ideas are to make mockups of a hypothetical dating site front page or ad and use them instead of real images  suggestions ,0

 april utc the game is an abstract mental game  the objective of which is to forget its existence there is no point in calling the game a meme  the majority of stuff on wikipedia is a meme  a meme is simply any idea or concept  i think what this refers to is a common misconception of the word meme  basically meaning a fad  the game has some interesting memetic properties  but these should be described elsewhere in the article if anywhere  whoever wants the meme version up should read the meme article first ,0
 i think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe  especially given that in a prior version you yourself wrote attempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not work which it seems to me is the very essence of  extreme  red tape  if you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness  but i don t see how that better informs the reader  i also don t see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success  obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they ve been tasked to do  to spell out that their desire was to achieve the productivity that was possible would be completely superflous  of course that was the goal  and surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity faster decrypting etc  meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective  your wording doesn t mention any of that stuff anyway  further  as i ve said before  i also don t see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are a  the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources b  churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche  showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions  what doesn t matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists  paperclips  light bulbs  some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e g  some kind of for want of a nail type angle look  prime minister  you ve gathered all these first class minds here but we can t get anything done because we have to do our own bloody typing  if sources lay something like that out  am i missing something p s  what do you mean about wp civ  ,0
 none  beefart replies  thanks for you comments  few take the time to discuss grammar on wikipedia and it shows in many articles  i disagree with you about  none the word comes from the old norse ne an  which means  literally no one in my view  to get the sense of any usage of  none  we must expand it in our minds to no one it is impossible to say no one are dinosaurs it has to be no one is a dinosaur here are two examples from the oed e j  howard except for her eyes  none of her features was remarkable p  rose people sought her  but none was a companion  however  the plot thickens  because the oed also gives this example from graham greene  who is highly regarded as a writer  none of our wives are invited  this flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the oed has given up the fight  maybe i ought to as well there are of course some situations where expanding none to no one does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural e g  none of the increase is due to here the best we can hope for is to propose that none is a synonym for nothing i personally try to avoid expressions such as none of the increase and would be inclined to write no part of the increase ,0

 the truth about the sinn f  in ard fheis the story of how gerry adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a british constitutional party how he broke the sinn f  in constitution  created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting how he managed to expel himself and his supporters from sinn f  in membership and  how a small band of republicans managed to keep the sinn f  in constitution and traditional policy in tact  in section  b  of the sinn f  in constitution read as follows no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who  if elected  intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county or county  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions  shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership  the adams leadership put forward a motion  titled resolution at the ard fheis its wording was as follows resolution that this ard fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house  successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county elections a  shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle b  shall not draw their salaries for personal use parliamentary representatives shall be paid a sinn fein organiser s subsidy  and the leinster house salary shall be divided at the direction of the ard chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses  to accommodate this change  the constitution and rules be amended as follows that section  b of the constitution be amended to read no person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who  if elected  intend taking part in the proceedings of the westminster or partitionist county parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions  shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership  motion supports and approves of the candidature of persons who  if  elected  would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i e  on the direction of the ard chomhairle obviously  motion infringes section  b section  b  was in effect at the time this resolution was presented its clear that adams made a mistake in procedure he should have sought a majority decision to amend section  b  in and returned in to propose entering leinster house trying to amend section  b  and propose taking seats in the partitionist county parliament in the same resolution was a logical impossibility  can anybody say that  the wording that this ard fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to leinster house  successful sinn fein parliamentary candidates in county elections a shall attend leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in leinster house as directed by the ard chomhairle  clearly adams was in breach of section  b  and according to that section he had expelled himself  and all those who voted for resolution brian feeney  in his book  sinn f  in turbulent years  puts forward the argument that adams had managed to bypass section  b  by introducing a motion in allowing the discussion of any aspect of the sinn f  in constitution this change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of section  b in any way to discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it for example  conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it in fact the line adams added in was superfluous  as the sinn f  in constitution had never banned the discussion of anything just the approving and supporting of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments of course its not illegal to amend or remove section  b  section  b  bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in british assemblies  it can be removed or amended at any ard fheis by a two thirds majority  the reason for doing so could be many  perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the republic  in fact its not necessary  according to the constitution  to give any reason  but you,0

 section needs to be edited this line about new hampshire is not very accurate on january for the first time  martin luther king day was officially observed in all states prior to that new hampshire and arizona did not observe the day in fact  new hampshire passed civil rights day in to honor dr king  and other civil rights activists like rosa parks and malcolm x since the article states clearly that other states  such as utah  have different names for the holiday  including combining it with confederate military heroes  this sentence does not seem justifiable the article leaves the impression that new hampshire was some sort of bigoted state  that was one of the last to recognize this holiday i am a newbie to wikipedia  how do we fix this  ,0

 doherty epilogue why does the section mainstream scholarly reception end in a comment by doherty  himself decidedly not a part of that mainstream  which basically says that someone else should come along  isn t this akin to a proponent of a minority view saying that one day  oh happy day  the majority will come to see the wisdom of the minority view and change its mind  revision and changing minds are an essential part of all branches of scholarship but why should we give a platform to any one view in this smile back well  i do see your point  but i think there s arguably validity in assigning a special preference to the view of the subjects of the article  of which doherty is a notable example  and the only one  i m aware  that has commented on the subject  ,0

deletion of av news page just curious why the av news page is being deleted while its primary competitor antelope valley press is allowed to have its page here unmolested granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as av press and even more so than av town crier  whose page is also allowed to be here i note here is the content the av news began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in lancaster  california usa  it was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in in the av news added a website and in march much like the seatte post intelligencer  the av news  trans itioned to a web only publication  the av news covers the antelope valley area of los angeles county mainly the palmdale lancaster urbanized area  a us census bureau defined term  and areas of north los angeles and southeastern kern counties  including acton  agua dulce  edwards afb  lake los angeles  mojave  quartz hill  rosamond and santa clarita  the newspaper is conservative in its political stance  it is currently the official news publication of the lancaster jethawks  a minor league baseball team in lancaster history  the av news was founded by fran paolinelli in she continues to work at the publication today  it began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at w avnewsday com  the paper  conservative leaning  holds strongly held views  which can become controversial at times competitors in its market are the daily news  antelope valley press and the los angeles times external links av news official website  the format is the same as the av press  there is less historical info that the av press because we have only been going for six years and they ve been up for decades  but still  we are getting e mails from people who use wiki to find out about the lancaster palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed i also point out that the city of lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team please info me as to what more i need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page ,0

  i asked you to ensure you were accurate because if you were wrong wp spade i would accurately call you a liar  user bullrangifer made a comment that my alleged use of unreliable sources doesn t exactly help your credibility  however this statement was not true at all and has no basis in reality it was fabricated simply to damage my credibility he says this despite the fact that i had not used any unreliable sources on the page  his poorly thought out and executed statement affects his own credibility rather than mine  when asked for clarification of his accusation  he produces four links  of the four  two were posted after his offensive comment was made  therefore  i assume he was taking about the first two links that i had already provided when he said it the first two links  both of them  were from of newspaper articles from the washington post yes both of them this person has says that particular source is not reliable and that he can produce more reliable sources  that damages his credibility  not mine i m calling bull shit  on everything he said for the reasons above i am calling user bullrangifer a liar  chimes in with his two cents supporting the same contention as the the last discredited guy he got his lame comment in before i posted the second two links  those links were for the associated press and government of canada  but lots of other reliable places have this stuff he didn t back up his statement by responding with the source that he was referring to and lost credibility too  for this reason is also a liar that s not all  this person must be the brains of this operation  right here on this page  puts forth the argument that and none of this shows that there is no chemtrails conspiracy theory  i think his credibility was lacking prior to his comment about me it s pretty obvious that logical thinking is lacking here too previously i ve called his position the  dumb est possible argument for anything  ever ,0

 unblock disclaimer  i do not identify as a  nazi neo  nazi facist  neo fascist  i do not accept or agree with the actions or views of  hitler  or any other dictators in the world for that matter  i do not  hate  jew s  in fact i have many jew ish friends  hello  although this is technically an unblock appeal  it is really only a reason to explain  you won t be in a mood to unblock me when i m finished talking  first of all i want to apologise  i should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page  this is the reason for that  i have a few jew ish friends  and normally we sometimes make jokes about jew s and christians and things like that  i never really make jokes about the holocaust  because that never go over well with them and it is not nice  well  apparently  a joke about jew s being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew but claims he is  now he thinks i am a facist nazi and i  hate  jew s  i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so i came home and started messing around on my userpage  second of all  i would like to ask why it is not permissable to self identify as a  nazi  there are several userboxes dealing with this subject  there is even a userbox that states  this user identifies as a  hitler ist  what the hell you will let people say they support  hitler but you won t let them say they are  nazi s being a  nazi  does not mean that you condone  hitler  or his actions  it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind  nazi sm  you can be a  nazi  and not support the horrible eugenics policy  but if you are  hitler ist  that obviously says you support all that  your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jew s  well if you are taking that into account  then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist  that can be extremely offensive to christians  if you want me to  i can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia  with reference of a nice book i think i will  one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all  and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you  they also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room  you were then forced to excrete over everyone  you were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it  it was alright if you stood perfectly still  but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails  they also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up  they would do that for hours on end  then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce christ  the holocaust was horrible  but i would rather be gassed or hung by a  nazi  than endure those tortures for years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences  so could you ban all communists please my last comment is in response to chzz s question about me making the gay  comment  statement  nowadays the word  gay  is used for two meanings  one is homo sex ity and the other is wierd  stupid dumb i was using the second connotation  maybe if you people didn t spend so much time on this  gay sorry  stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words  even if you unblock me  which you won t i will take a wikibreak  i don t want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life  i have already recieved a punishment  never becoming an admin  the whole  gay sorry dumb  trust thing just know this  i would have enventually removed the swastika after i cooled down and because of your  gay sorry dumb  policy you have lost a serious editor  this whole thing has really annoyed me  p s  chzz  i have been on wikipedia for years  you think i forgot to sign my  gay sorry  stupid post  yeah right  ,0

 singer list hi  i have an idea that would allow people to view various prospects for scott weilands replacement in an easier way rather than just posting sentences in the split from weiland section  how about someone ends the split  section with a closing paragraph about scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like rumored replacement singers or something like that  and that section can have an opening statement saying numerous individuals have been considered for scott weilands replacement  they include and then below  write a list of every person who has been rumored  it is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that vr is looking for a new singer  anyways  please let me know what you think on this idea  i am open to criticism and it doesnt bother me if you disagree with this idea  just let me know  thanks  zach ,0

under such criteria  you better be inserting notability templates into each and every unsourced article that exists since we have had unsourced blps in wikipedia for years  that is not sufficient criteria for determining if something is notable or not  the standard is if such could be found  there are already several sources in the article about several european groups in mexico such as the mennonites and spanish refugees  could the article be improved  definitely  but notability is not an issue except to those who beleive that europeans or whites do not  or better stated  should not  exist in latin america ,0

  again  i disagree  scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness  particularly for the question of the roma and the disable in fact  as you go through modern academic literature  the last years holocaust more and more includes non jewish victims  just an example  alex callinicos  from york university the holocaust isfor good reasons i need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil  all the different kinds of domination fused together in auschwitzracism  directed at jew s  slavs  and roma  the economic exploitation of slave labour  the oppression of  gay s and women  the persecution of dissenting minorities such as communists and jehovah s witnesses  or slawomir kapralski  identity building and the holocaust  roma political nationalism  i have already mentioned sybil milton  who was a senior historian at the research institute of the us holocaust memorial museum and henry friedlander  a leading holocaust historian in the usa  is another important voice  this increasing consensus has had an impact on common language as well on political bodies  see this press release from the un  for instance  it is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist  mordern project  and the common fate of the victims  the famous pictures of mengele s twins are of roma children  the technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the t the tactics of eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of poland  against polish leaders  i have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of jew s in the holocaust  i have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity  if this is not enough  let me try in another way  by deciding to describe the holocaust as an  exclusive  jew ish event  wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate  i could say on the  declining  side of an ongoing scholarly debate this is not holocaust denial  with no legitimacy in the academia  and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes  at very least wikipedia must admit the existence of debate in the lead  ,0

  i don t understand how you can claim that other uses or otherwise  has any kind of meaning to anyone other than the one that wrote it  and possibly you it seems  if the templates are changed then that either means that the display should also be changed or that it is the reason they are changing the template  either way  the change itself would likely nullify this argument  i agree with magio above  this seems to be nothing more than a subtle way at irritating other editors by somehow logically trying to argue nonsense  ,0

 anyone have any thoughts on the addition of bernard lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians since augustine  aquinas are listed and lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of catholic philosophers  i thought he would be a good addition to the list  his work is well regarded in th century philosophy  he certainly has the credentials  and i think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of aristotle  augustine and aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory  epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the data of consciousness and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science  see insight  a study of human understanding  there are lonergan centers at boston college  university of toronto  seton hall  and loyola marymount university devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology  i m quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any jesuit schools would consider his work notable my attempt at this addition was reverted as not particularly notable as a metaphysician so  thought i would throw it out there  ,0

 speedy deletion of indian association of special libraries and information centres  a tag has been placed on indian association of special libraries and information centres requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia  this has been done under section a  of the criteria for speedy deletion  because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader  please see wikipedia stub for our minimum information standards for short articles  also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content  if you think that this notice was placed here in error  you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article  just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the article s talk page explaining your position  but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion  if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay  please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself  but don t hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedia s policies and guidelines  ,0

thanks for replying  off hand  i m not convinced that investigating your reply wizard and how it works would have speeded up this conversation i checked the deletion log before querying this with you  it merely refers to criteria f invalid fair use claim  without any further explanation of exactly why  as you have now given in this instance the stamp image is not used simply as an illustration  where as per policy an alternative illustration  for example  by scanning the covers and creating a similar collage  could have been created  it also makes an important contribution to the discussion of the series  by demonstrating that it is sufficiently important for a stamp to have been created depicting the series as a whole  the existence of the stamp itself is noteable for a mention in the article i note that criteria is not a wiki policy but merely a guideline  and is stated to be one example of acceptable usage  not an exhaustive list  the policy above states that usage must follow the spirit of the policy at the top of the page  not the guideline list of examples regards ,0

 well  in case anyone s interested in following up on this further  using the la trobe university on line search engine  a search for the term mah  purisalakkha truncated to allow for various inflections  leads to bjt  record hits  at least of which are in the pali canon here s the first page of the search results  with links to the subsequent pages as well http w chaf lib latrobe edu au dcd pitikaresults php title  start to searchstring  mah  purisalakkha of course  this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term  nor what this term means in the context of various suttas  since multiple records can be part of a single sutta  similarly  this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term  etc fwiw  a quick review of these results  potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas  shows hits in the digha nikaya in the majjhima nikaya  none in the samyutta nikaya in the anguttara nikaya  and in the canonical khuddaka nikaya  mostly in the suttanipata in the paracanonical kn words  e g netti  peta one in the abhidhamma s kathavatthu  once in the visuddhimagga  and times in the pali histories if nothing else  this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by peter and myself might possibly be  among the core texts with metta  talk ,0

 as daft as it sounds yes  if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp truth wp verifable wp rs wp nor and wp nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism talk contrib as it says on my talk page  i prefer to have discussions all in the same place  i am watching this page  so please reply here  to this end i have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here  so if i add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in ssds either  you ll insist on a source for that too seriously  you are mistaken on a few points  i think you need to read wp verify yourself all material in wikipedia mainspace  including everything in articles  lists and captions  must be verifiable  all quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged  must include an inline citation that directly supports the material  any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed emphasis added jeh note the distinction  you wrote if it can t be verified it gets removed but  first  the claim that ssds contain no disks obviously can be verified  not only is it part of the definition of the term  the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices  so  no  we don t need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim  and second  except for blp issues  wp v only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed  this material didn t need a source  and even if it did  it isn t required to remove it right away  even for claims that really should have a citation to a wp rs  the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a citation needed template  see template cn  this is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone s edit rather than simply reverting it  i suppose you could say well  since i removed it  its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source  yeah  fine  so i go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that s already there  and then cite that same ref from my new text as well  no  it s not much work  but consider  does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one  is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here  was it the best use of yours  and will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to wp in the future also  in my edit i merely noted that despite the term solid state disk there are no actual disks inside these devices  in your edit comment you said since they refer to it is a disk we must to  sic well  that is true  but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms solid state disk or electronic disk from the article  nor even claim that such were wrong  so your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action  finally  i must point out that you are wrong about vandalism  the fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism  after reading wp verify you should probably look at wp vandalism even if misguided  willfully against consensus  or disruptive  any good faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism  edit warring over content is not vandalism  careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial  detrimental but well intentioned  and vandalizing  mislabelling good faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful emphasis added jeh you should probably also read wp agf to see what good faith means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it  in sum  please be careful about undo ing others  edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like wp verify  consider using the cn template rather than reverting unsourced material  please think carefully before tossing around words like vandalism and you should never have intentions of edit warring so the statement that you don t have any here is troubling  why would you need to state such a thing  if not for the possibility that you might have s,0

 mediawiki duplicate defaultsort do you realize what a wonderful thing this is when you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created i hope not because i have been  although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under s and t while i finish l and do m through r i will not complain when i stumbled across the category there were pages in it by the end of today there will be fewer than my goal is to get all the non trivial items resolved by the end of next week so i can start on the pages in category biography articles without listas parameter  a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life  because i am resolving the conflicts in the first category i have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks  like you  who know why the banners work as they do i have also leaned what items can set the defaultsort  as an added bonus i have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts i did not know before and i have become almost addicted to preview the absolutely best part about the dup ds is that the category it has created  that i will continue to monitor on a daily basis  is a safety net for me when i mess something up on a page in  category biography articles without listas parameter the easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it  wants it  and will throw a fit if it is not there thank you  ,0

 xkcd  hey a fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for nasa from the short article on me  randall munroe labeling it patently made up information understandable and taken in good humor  of course  and nothing on the page is sourced  it s more of a stub than anything but i m curious why you were so sure it was fabricated  xkcd i find it hard to believe that a year old could have been working full time for nasa  of course  you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that nasa would have been all over  but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe schreit mich an  i interned there during college and started working for them a bit before i graduated i stayed for the better part of a year until late nasa is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects it s not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets anyway  the information is taken from my published bio page  but you re right  you have no way of knowing whether i m lying or not i guess it s probably safest to assume that i am  in that case  i ll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place  i know very little about science  but anyone who got to work for nasa has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area feel free to re add the info  although the impression i got from the original version was more than you weren t just a contract worker  if that s not even a valid distinction in the states it s increasingly less of one here in oz then my apologies there in advance schreit mich an honestly  they never really explained to me which one i was i went to work every day in a building at nasa where i worked on nasa robots  and nasa paid me  through a government contractor when i said i work for nasa no one argued  it was a lot more dilbert esque than you would expect old  echoing tile hallways with quiet  gruff middle aged men working at blueprint covered desks  mild office politics  lots of presentations and buzzwords  and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way i thought it sounded like the perfect place to work  and it was good in a lot of ways  but i was happy to leave xkcd can you nominate my entry hey bighaz  can you please show me how the nomination process goes for dyk  i mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated  actually  this thing is new to me  thanks sure thing  the way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the hook that gets put onto the suggestions page  which i ll move it to in a moment  over the next few days  people will make various comments about it if the hook is too long  if it needs sources  w hate ver else  if you re able to respond to those comments  if there are any made then your article might get selected schreit mich an by suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what it s not easy to do that  since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page  so i really can t just point you to a page and say here you are what particularly do you want to see  if you re after examples of the kinds of comments people make  just keep an eye on the suggestions page schreit mich an caucasian ethnicities semites are caucasian  or indeed not  see  for example  semitic  which clearly indicates otherwise  they speak wildly different languages to those spoken by indo european people  who are the ones we normally call caucasian so unless there s some startling new research out there  i don t think that comment is accurate schreit mich an  i m not even going to dignify this with a response  use,0

  history of primal therapy article  i read through the recent discussions on talk primal therapy  i also added two more comments to the talk arthur janov page  did you send an email enquiry  the date for france d s marriage to art is without credibility  after the divorce  to vivian s great credit  she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate arthur janov  after all  he wrote in the original primal scream it is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through primal therapy have never separated  chapter and according to france d  janov s own admission in the primal center s video series she enrolled at the primal institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates  so it s a fact that art married a former patient my feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub  the content of the arthur janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry  it isn t really the place to dissect janov s reputation  i know it happens in other wikipedia biographies  but in many cases it has got out of hand  i agree with your suggestion on the primal therapy talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate history of primal therapy article  the conocer piece doesn t strike me as a sound source of verifiable information  so i put together some links to articles which can be found online if you type emotional intelligence into google the no result is steve hein s eqi org website  he interviewed a former patient who attended arthur janov s primal center in the late s  you can find his interview notes here  labelled cautionary note janov s bio on the primal center website states the latest research conducted at dr  janov s primal center on the effects of primal therapy on the brain was performed by dr  erik hoffman  former professor of neurophysiology at copenhagen university  you can read  what erik hoffmann  ph d is doing now at hoffmann s website on this page you can find a  trans cript of dr  e  michael holden s account of what happened to him after he left the primal institute carol mither s book  therapy gone mad  identifies case histories from janov s first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against the center for feeling therapy simon thanks  simon why can t you create an account like normal wikipedians complete with a talk page  i don t think the history idea will come to much  there is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it especially in view of cgingold s latest analyses on the primal therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals  i have already read the michael holden swan song twice sad case  you seem to be applying two standards of evidence  the primal therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on arthur janov s books alone  which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center  last september  i wrote in the primal therapy talk page  will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about stettbacher s method  or the international primal association  or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the s  there is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start  two books about the center for feeling therapy  erik hoffmann s bio  and the  trans cript of dr  e  michael holden s audio tape which was played a number of times at the ipa convention in the books by carol mithers and tomas videg  rd are already referenced in the main article  i have a copy of videg  rd s book  by the way  also  professor steven rose wrote a one page account of his research with arthur janov in lifelines as janov had hoped  it turned out that before therapy  the quantity of these particular receptors in his client s platelets was considerably below normal  within six months of therapy  clients  depression had lifted  and the biochemical and immunological measures i was making approached the average for  normal  non depressed people of the same age and sex  further down the same page he added i obtained similar biochemical results when  a couple of years later  i did a similar study with depressed clients going through other  less dramatic forms of psychotherapy  so i suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory  having participated in the editing of articles in t,0

 yeah i think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors  aren t just mere repetitions of the author s statement and don t elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily  also i ll like to point out these mistakes in your comment per eliade  approximative understanding  partly of apparently non arabian rites  so not much eildae never says it was non arabian  she s talking about monophysite rites and monophysite was the largest branch of christianity in arabia per watt  details that may be surmised by close analysis muhammad s life he also argues that these verses might be attacking christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs  also in the final i ll like to say again the subject of the article isn t about quran and it s historicity and interpretations  so adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text  ,0

 trimming sounds fine  but where a dispute comes up  i would recommend slowing things down focus on one or two specific quotes  and if someone reverts  instead of immediately reverting back  try to come up with a compromise version ditto with the other person reverting  instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version  try to come up with a compromise with each person changing each other s work  rather than reverting  it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version  also  use clear  calm  and neutral edit summaries  referring strictly to the article  and not the editors in terms of refactoring  what i was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to when a post is phrased such as you did this wrong or he is unwilling or he s just always stubborn then that s getting away from discussing the article content  and is veering off into discussing the editors better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors good habits to develop  though they can take  time to get the hang of it are to avoid the words you and your also  avoid naming specific editors in a post  as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive  and then they may miss everything else that s said  instead  when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done  diff the edit without mentioning the editor like  i disagree with this edit  diff as i feel it s a violation of  policy guideline a better way to handle things would be  suggestion i know it may sound a bit confusing to do this  but i have seen that using this kind of third party discussion technique  can work wonders in de escalating disputes it also tends to make whoever is using the technique  sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful  even if off wiki they may be hopping mad  it also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action when an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute  and they see everyone yelling at each other  the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong the admin won t care who started it they ll just address things as they see them in that moment but if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly  and one editor being uncivil  then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption caveat  just because one editor is being uncivil  doesn t necessarily mean that they re in the wrong but if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they re doing is name calling  rather than actually discussing the article  then that s a problem that an administrator can easily address  by removing the non constructive editors from the discussion  onka  ,0

it was not my intent to editorialize the article on marcel lefebvre  but i was trying to correct and add some information about him i did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro lefebvre position as well i felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about lefebvre the two people who i called arch conservative were exactly that both men tried to derail the second vatican council  and fought both john xxi and paul vi and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way i don t know if thomas jefferson actually said this or not  it was a quote the jefferson character made in the movie that he felt that king george i was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the declaration of independance  so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant and i have talked to catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals especially in the times before the second vatican council why do you think that  sex  abuse of children became such a crisis for the church it was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity i remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while  he didn t exactly what his grandfater s reasons were  but he said it probably wasn t hard to guess why even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass  it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way  that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass  but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article that s why i added the tag  because what i read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction jun utc ,0

 double standard reloaded who is interested in debating and who is not  who is interested in developing the article and who is interested in freezin it to death  including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules after all  it never too much to remind that  an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue  over a year and a half  he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone  during all this time  i have responded to him in the same mode  but especifically to these assertions  not having any left unanswered  unlike him and only me is who was warned and  block  curious  summary of operations to the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones see above the heart of this case  as well as the sections spurious quotations  once again  and sections warning to judge by yourselves ii in my talk page to note that from grammatical objections to the size of version that i propose  no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed even taking into account that the present version incurs spurious quote in the  st paragraph too detailed and redundant information  for an article that are supposed to be short on the  nd paragraph and incomplete besides be longer  vague and non neutral in the  rd how not to think in double standard when the last disruptive revertion  besides be longer than the version i propose  was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as i shown above  again  see above points a to e in once again section that were related only to the  nd paragraph  of the version i propose and that no word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the  st paragraph  as well as against or about the  rd paragraph  that according to some editor  ctr f on word solid to see above  on the discussion about grammar in the once again section was pretty solid and even so  the revertion was done so  i again ask you all is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances in the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral  which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime  monarchical  military  etc w hate ver be worse  which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above even if this purposes are involuntary  although the time that passed without actions having been taken  as well as the resistance to remediation maintained  only makes this possibility  of involuntariness  unlikely which group of honest editors  ladies and gentlemen  who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument  would vote against such remediation or would omit about it ,0

roazir  fars is the arabic version of pars  the iranian name when  trans lated to english is the gulf of pars and the english name persian gulf means exactly the same thing  interestingly enough most gulfs in the world are called like the iranian name for e g  gulf of mexico  gulf of aden  gulf of carpentaria  gulf of the farallones  gulf of maine  gulf of tonkin  gulf of guinea  etc  etc  so the correct name for the persian gulf should have been the gulf of pars just as the iranian name is  as for the azarbaijan  as both versions already exist on the wiki and we are not inventing a new name  i insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region  the whole population of rep azerbaijan is less than of the population of iran  let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word  azarbaijan like iranians do  so why a vast majority should follow a small minority  it is azarbaijan and english speaking people better get used to it ,0

 i butter is a butter substitute the references given  see discussion on this above  on this are improperly given  what is given appears to be little more than a google screen scrape  i managed to find both references and they do not support this usage  the use in these publications is not to define but to indicate the broad category  peanut butter  if placed in the category of a  nut butter is also in the category if  butter substitute  but it is not a type of margarine  which is what this product is  possibly it might be helpful to say that the product is commonly used to substitute butter but it doesn t help in the basic definiton  ,0

hi  we have three members already  we all seem interested in the project  i have created a template to place on article s talk pages  an user from the spanish wikiproject has just suggested that we  trans late articles from one wikipedia to the other using an automatic  trans lator  but no one responded yet  one of the members is interested in writing about  gay  literature  and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be  gay  literature or lgbt literature  i believe this was the first discussion of the project  two of us think that lgbt literature would be best  i don t have a lot of time to dedicate to the project  so i would like it if it didn t depend on me to survive and grow and be successful  the other two members have asked what they can do for the project  i would like to write something to better explain what a wiki project is for  because this seems unclear  i believe it s not much of a big deal  it s just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place  so if something important happens concerning that subject  for example a page gets nominated for deletion all interested people get to know  it should also create a sense of community  and it s good to have that since we ll be editing the same articles  i think things are going fine  except that i don t know whether the other members see this as i do ,0

 marduk abraham  the early prophet line is reflected in all the history of the world marduk is a regional variant of abraham  so is zoroaster adam as we know him  was the first prophet of dyeus  and the first human consciousness we see in history  dyeus  became zeus  jupiter  with piter from fertilitycult distortions  and yah  etc  god ofcourse for many  idris was the second prophet of tengri  which became thor many places sometimes god  sometimes more of a prophet  and again indra prometheus osiris these concepts are known everywhere with local variations  knowing the regional names  one can see the same change in the regions who talk about marduk  as here  a change from early prophetic teachings  to that of abraham and sarai of the bible  is saraswati in hinduism  and sarpanit here  obviously we all have the same prophetic line  teaching monotheism god is without others peace be with you  ,0

 naji al ali hi ian i noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to what is your source for that  i m wondering because the arabic wikipedia article  which this page started as a  trans lation from  cites his year of birth as while a book i have about him the one referenced in the article cites it as what the book says in a footnote on the subject is sulaiman al shaikh the caricature artist naji al ali in the kuwaiti magazine al  arabi  no august naji al  ali saw this date and did not raise any objection  while the book is certainly not academic  it s also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is khalid al  ali  the artist s son on the other hand  on this page naji al ali himself is quoted as saying i was born where christ was born  between tiberias and nazareth in the village of al shahra in the northern galilee  and i was expelled from there ten years later in to  ain al hilwe camp in lebanon  however  the same site also bases its short biography of naji al  ali on the book i used  and gives the year for his birth accordingly unless you have a solid source  i think we may have to leave it as unknown by the way  that site also shows a pretty cool pflp poster about his assassination  i wonder could we get permission to use it  all the best  talk  ,0

  north korea actually gained approximately km from china in the treaty  and here s a th century book by chong yagyong  titled korea s northern border reigion in a korean sourcebook compilation  trans lated by peter hacksoo lee a long time ago  the area north of the tumen river was the land of the su shen people  it has not been under our control since the time of the three han  the southern slopes of mount changbaek  where both the tumen and yalu rivers have their headwaters  lay within our territory  but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear  however  emperor k ang hsi  in the final years of his reign ordered area commander wu la  wu la ts ung kuan  muk eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker  as a result  the border between those two rivers is clear as well emphasis mine here s another study of the us north korea border in by the us dept of state  which makes no mention of north korea owning the entire mountain and another  which says that china actually made concessions to nk on the border in the only sources that seem to claim that korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest china conducting activities on its own side of the border  and of course  a few ultranationalist sites  but please  enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well  on another rather amusing note  it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits  and which prefer to judge a book by it s cover and lash out emotionally  should be made in a new section on the talk page  no further edits should be made to this section  the result of the debate was no move  requested move chonji tianchi the name was unilaterally moved from tianchi to chonji without concensus  for pov reasons  cited in move and talk page such as that it should be korean  it s on the border between china and korea another reason cited was that the name of the baekdu mountain page is korean as well  however  a google search shows nearly hits for tianchi  and and less than each for chonji and cheonji  that s two orders of magnitude in difference the preceding was quoted by yuje survey add support or oppose followed by a brief explanation  then sign your opinion with support for the most common name  searches for chonji for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits  search on google scholar shows only uses of the name chonji for the lake  the use of chonji as a clear common name doesn t apply because it s not common  support per yuje naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name oppose per visviva and my previous comments  like i said before  we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because tianchi is a name for many other places in china  as shown  chonji is nowhere near common  chonji barely shows up any hits  therefore isn t a viable alternative for a clear alternative name  oppose look at my reason below  comment the proposition seems to be flawed given that tianchi is now an article on the lake in urumqi  if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else  perhaps tianchi  changbaishan  or even  heh heh  tianchi  paektusan but then again maybe tianchi  jilin if we must have a straw poll  it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is  comment the issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldn t be ignored  thus perhaps tianchi could be a disambiguation page  or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a tianchi  disambiguation  page  either one is a reasonable alterna,0

i m pretty new to wikipedia  but it seems quite inaccurate to say that the majority of highlanders were roman catholic  aside from the populations of the tiny islands of barra and south uist  and a few small areas on the mainland the majority of them would have been presbyterians or nonjurant episcopalians  even amongst the clans on the jacobite side of the rebellion only the chisholms  gordons  macneils from barra and some macdonalds from glengarry and glencoe are listed as roman cathloic according to john prebble in culloden  i m not going to change that part of this article  but it would be good for someone to have a look at it since its not true ,0

  please consult the article ball culture  which states drag queen  or  trans gendered wp or does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together as well  the term femme queen does not have an article  so the term is currently of dubious usage as it s a neologism which wp policy suggests to avoid using you state a source tgmsmnet however neither this page  nor the mainpage refer to such a reference from the way you talked about it  i linked it to the mstsw reference in the future  if you could  could you please site resources on this page by using this form http example com http example com  that way it shows up like this http w example com  and one can simply click on the resource  rather than search through the article for the reference itself your data is backed up there as well however  we still have issue  how would the cdc consider a post op mtf living in stealth as anything else but a female the mtf would obviously not admit to being a  trans  sex and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a biological female  i wait for further evidence that tg ts is caused by biological factors  and thus the term biological male female becomes complicated in even research  no one would ever state that a woman with cais is biologically a male  as well  i understand the point of not using wp as a soap box  however in talk pages  i m still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term people having urap ,0

wikipedia miscellany for deletion user propaniac su hi  i ve just noticed that you nominated this page in my userspace for deletion at mfd a couple months ago  and it was deleted  tbh  i don t remember what was there  and i was just curious if you remembered the topic  or how you came to notice it in my userspace in the first place i m not objecting to the deletion  although i m kind of surprised that it was worth the trouble of deleting  and to find out that wikipedia has a policy that allows for deleting of unfinished drafts in userspace  i mean  that seems ironic in light of all the total crap in article space that i ve tried to delete but that s been saved on the theory that maybe someday someone might possibly come along and turn it into something worthwhile but  again  i m not objecting or suggesting anything wrong took place  just wondering how it happened  thanks for any light you can shed ,0

 please take a break i have been reading this snafu you are doing yourself no favors  please take a break  i just want to work on improving and creating articles etc yes  defending myself is a laborious activity  but to hear exaggerations and hypocrisy thrown at me in an effort to demonize me for expulsion to protect the encyclopedia is hard to stay away from  the overall nature of said activity is wp baiting and things like the cfd and the hostile rm closures is agf npa in the extreme  who should  take a break  is the chorus cadre whose primary activity on wikipedia seems to be attacking contributing editors by any specious and pov agf rationale available  i know i m not alone in being attacked and vilified this way  and yes  there s far more productive things to be doing than arguing with people who only want to argue  ,0
 useful documentation for this comparison can be found on p of gabriel danovitch handbook of kidney  trans plantation philadelphia  lippincott where he states that the most efficient hemodialysis regimens currently provide only tp of the small solute removal achieved by two normally functioning kidneys  this comment should be updated  however  by reference to data from the new programs of short  and long daily home hemodialysis performed six days or nights a week  which improve solute clearance  although still fall far short of achieving what normal kidneys can do  user  jp marat ,0

  i m not sure from that comment how much you understand about research in this area there is for example a dispute about the validity of self reported results in the general evidence base for cbt which has gained momentum in the last five years a lot of new work has been done since that would throw those claims into dispute at the moment you are giving prominence to a one country study in a controversial area that is itself years old that is cherry picking as the table gives a false impression of cbt s position in the pantheon of methods i can understand an advocate pushing it  but we have to be balanced here  talk  ,0

 note from the subject book r  la prabhup  da l  l  m ta and he did not have to flatter anyone  support anyone  or manage anyone s life  his mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master  he saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him  despite his advanced age  he felt that he had barely begun his work  yet he felt confident  he had his vision of a world association of devotees  it was not an idle dream  although he was not certain how it would all come about  but he knew his duty  for the present he would go on describing his vision  the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters  in articles and books  but as soon as possible he should go to the west  westerners  he had concluded  were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding  more than his fellow indians  they would be open to the message of the absolute truth  he knew he should go  and he would go if k a desired abhay lived frugally in v nd  vana  keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt  he carefully kept a ledger  just as if he were running a substantial business  even though his purchases were only a little milk  a few vegetables  charcoal for cooking  bus rides  and his major expenditure  postage abhay composed a bengali poem  v nd  vana bhajana  its opening stanzas were especially self reflective and personal i am sitting alone in v nd  vana dh  ma  in this mood i am getting many realizations  i have my wife  sons  daughters  grandsons  everything  but i have no money  so they are a fruitless glory  k a has shown me the naked form of material nature  by his strength it has all become tasteless to me today  yasy  ham anug h mi hari ye tad dhana anai i gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom i am merciful  how was i able to understand this mercy of the all merciful r  la prabhup  da is here in the advanced age of his supporters  friends and family left him broke  r  la prabhup  da l  l  m ta another reference prabhup  da s most ambitious literary undertaking  the completion of r  mad bh  gavatam  was to be no less than sixty volumes  he had begun in india in and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age  now k a was giving him opportunities both for writing vedic literatures and for travelling  and he was working at an amazing pace  prabhup  da is here in advanced age of starting to write his bhaktivedanta purports i guess in india it was an advanced age  but not in florida  ,0

 utc  i don t think the definition from webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written the idea that professionals supply disinterested counsel and service to others  for a direct and definite compensation  wholly apart from expectation of other business gain is a bit naive  particularly in the i think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required  for instance  in the light of holocaust  in which many german professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state  which would tend to indicate that service for others may not be have the intention  but was taken to a tragic extreme  likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker  if it is a profession  has shown to conducted wholly for business gain  i e  higher profit  larger bonuses whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain  often to the detriment to the business  e g  accountants in the enron scandal i am not saying that perks is the ideal source of information  but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition  and one that is couched in more modern language  talk contribs november ,0

 disruptive activity please stop your disruptive editing  if you continue to vandalize wikipedia  as you did at paracetamol  you may be  block  from editing  email yeah  so i add two interesting and important new  relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the paracetamol page  these are removed because you guys don t like primary sources  this is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with wikipedia  my wife is pregnant  i for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug  i would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the first do no harm idea  the fact that you wikipedia  jerk s are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of w hate ver it takes for a given article is so frustrating  i ve continued to run into this kind of thing  you would think that academic journals have taken over wikipedia  the idea that i have actually improved the article with my additions  and that others can improve it further  has completely escaped much of the wikipedia culture these days  wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited  rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides  you guys are disgusting  really  you are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are  namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements  now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created wikipedia in the first place  the fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply  i m sorry that i ve upset you  but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day  that is why we ve written wp medrs which i pointed to when i reverted you  there is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at wp whymedrs  the fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can t be  trans ferred into clinical practise  medrs is no catch all  but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier  i would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically  for example by having fda warnings automatically added i understand it may feel as if you re being reverted by a faceless mass  but i assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive  email this isn t about my feelings  it is about your behavior  you revert me with no reason  then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense  then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing  this is why wikipedia is dying  cannibalizing its editors and edits in a kafkaesque farce  congratulations  i m sure your no doubt proper and uplifting zyzzyxrd will be cited upon its demise  you may want to try and comprehend your own actions  and not my feelings  see ,0

 you resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile binksternet  for starters  dating back to the original discussion back in december while the user optigan liked financialnorth he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo  to which no including paulh or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion  as i m saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed  no decision was made and the discussion ended  paulh  or you did not say anything  if he wanted the photo then  why didn t he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then  i would ve left it at that then  but instead he and other editors remained silent  i didn t restart the discussion because i assumed that the editors simply lost interest  or didn t have the time furthermore  i did not slip in as you disgustingly  dishonestly  facetiously say  i only added that photo because i noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in january  again  no one did anything for months  you and paulh cannot claim you didn t see the change  because you made several other edits throughout the article for months again  paul did not form a consensus prior to the change  or continue the discussion where it had left off  once again  he instead changed the photo  got a consensus from binksternet  the ip editor liked the photo  but  quoting the editor again any of the photos in that section financialnorth jpg montgomerystreetsf jpg federal reserve band  san francisco  jpg except sanfranciscoembarcadero jpg  would be fine as a replacement  and even the cropped version of is better than the one currently there now  thoughts talk i m going to replace it with financialnorth jpg and see what happens  the crux of it was that paulh made the change before even binksternet approved it  or i or other editors could respond binksternet s abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts  despite my reverts  i at least agreed to having a discussion and a photo choosing contest as it were  paulh did not and binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing  i don t see binksternet asking the ip editor in question or other editors to the sf article including optigan have their say either in this  he is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus  something that at least paulh did earlier  only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or w hate ver personal victory he may get by flaming me ,0

 ivo banac  a bit of nonteleological history one of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the south slavs and the other peoples of southeastern europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography  this is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design  we have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making  for example  if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period  croatia is mainly a coastal area from the rasa river in istria to the cetina river  a little bit to the east of the city of split  down the coast from the original croatia  we have a row of unfamiliar slavic territories that constantine vii porphyrogenitus  the tenth century byzantine emperor historian  called pagania  literally  land of the pagans zachlumia  most of present day eastern herzegovina  with the croatian peninsula of peljesac terbounia  the trebinje area of eastern herzegovina  with dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs and dioclea  the southern portions of contemporary montenegro with the bay of kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present day albania around lake skadar shkoder serbia is located in the hinterland of zachlumia  terbounia  and dioclea  its center around ras  near today s novi pazar  in the sandzak  bosnia was apparently within this territory  but represented a negligible area around the source of the bosna river  where we now find sarajevo and its environs  and dalmatia  in the tenth century this was a necklace of byzantine ruled roman coastal cities and island territories  from krk in the north to ulcinj in the south moreover  modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity  thus  unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic as opposed to cultural continuity  the croat historical tradition goes back to the chronicle of the priest of dioclea  a twelfth century text from bar in contemporary montenegro  and its various  trans lations  for example  marko marulic which were in turn incorporated into the early modern slavic and dalmatian histories of mavro orbin and ivan lucic  ioannes lucius these works then became material for the croatianizing work of pavao ritter vitezovic  croatia rediviva who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of ljudevit gaj and that of postrevival integral nationalists like ante starcevic curiously  the same histories  orbin s  were serbianized through the  trans lations of sava vladislavic which then influenced the pioneering serbian histories of jovan rajic and were bulgarianized in the history of paisij hilandarski the bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self contained  it combined the franciscan memory of medieval bosnian statehood with the experiences of muslim ayan  notable  selfrule to argue for a uninational bosnia  for example  antun knezevic  whose book was published between and clearly  something has happened in the span of ten centuries  pagania  zachlumia  and terbounia have disappeared  the center of croatia has migrated from the adriatic to the north  into medieval slavonia  literally  slavic land with zagreb at its head  this happened in stages  during the high middle ages  the heart of croatia was on the una river  now in northwestern bosnia  this territory  turkish croatia  was lost to the ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of bosnia  during the habsburg reconquest and the concomitant venetian operations in the seventeenth century  the framework of modern croatia emerged in two extended shanks one  to the north  to modern slavonia  the other  in the south  in modern dalmatia  at the same time  the zagreb area  which was only dubiously croatian in the early middle ages  became the heart of modern croatia the story of serbia is not much different  serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated dioclea  then it moved to the ibar morava valleys  then toward the valleys of struma and vardar in macedonia  it reached the danube only as an ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century  and its modern capital  belgrade  became truly serbian only in the course of karadjordje s uprising in bosnia  too  expanded under ban  or prorex  kulin  r into the donji kraji  literally  lower lands  around the vrbas river and the soli  literally  salt lands  for centuries  ottoman  then modern tuzla  and usora  in its present northeastern corner  later on  at the height of its power in fourteenth century  bosnia expanded into hum  herzegovina  and the drina river valley  the westernmost regions were inc,0

 skywriter  i have tried to be civil with you i would ask that you return the favor remember  i didn t even write the old lede  i picked that as merely being most likely to be non controversial also note that on every single edit page  there s a big statement saying if you don t want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others  do not submit it  part of the edited mercilessly part is that people will criticize your writing it s nothing personal  if you see no evidence that kinzer s book brought about a massive reassessment of the coup in iran  then you did not read the book or the reviews  amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is  merely how good one is but w hate ver  you didn t include a direct mention in the most recent version  so let s just drop this  and for about the billionth time  since you mention in my edit summary that i m criticizing kinzer i m doing no such thing i m sure the book is very good  judging from the review given by the cia history fellow but very good is not the same as an element of crowning importance in the coup itself  people knew after that something had gone horribly wrong  so this was not a new revelation  aggression aside  snowfire  the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing you said earlier that your other comments are too general to address  if you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording  feel free to bring it here for comment  i decided to expand on the many problems with the lede  and now it s a windy analysis got it but aside from sniping  you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing it has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede there are a million and one possible  sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede  we have to pick which ones i have no doubt that your text was sourced  it doesn t mean it s automatically appropriate for the lede yes  and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night  fast and loose with facts let me say it again  are you denying that cold war paranoia had anything to do with the coup do you realize what references are for it s to confirm facts this fact is obvious and supported by every source  including your own  so it doesn t particularly matter what it was referenced to if you want to source it better have a blast  but this is not even close to fast and loose with the facts  albright s apology you ve got a point that the linked nytimes article doesn t call it apology remember  i didn t write the old lede fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than we d like the cia does cite vague fear of the soviet union in its most recent justification for the coup  however  the cia s accounting  published in three years after the publication of kinzer s path breaking book must be weighed against the cia s destruction of most of its documents related to this coup  wait  the cia destroyed the documents  so therefore the soviet union had nothing to do with it that logic doesn t flow more to the point  the idea that cold war machinations were behind the us involvement is in literally every source i haven t read all the shah s men  but from your linked book review  the one by a notable person  not from amazon reviewers it seems to be in that  too i quote eisenhower and his secretary of state  john foster dulles  were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by moscow s machinations kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic john foster and a cynical allen by ignoring the anticommunist basis of us policy  he wrenched the dispute with the aioc out of its cold war context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint  lastly  mossadeq s na  vete about communist tactics led him to ignore the tudeh party s efforts to penetrate and control iranian institutions  he seemed almost blithely unaware that pro soviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of eastern europe  by not reining in iran s communists  he fell on washington s enemies list  https w cia gov library center for the study of intelligence csi publications csi studies studies vol  no  article html yeah as a reminder this is from a review of your favored source  also note that dulles is described as moralistic  i e  interested in stopping the communists  not greedy interested in oil squares with what i know of dulles anyway  the overwhelming consensus is that the us was invol,0

hi mr ollie psoriosis and eczma common cause i would like edit it correctly so as to benefit many sufferers  i have simply copied in the three articles that join together to indicate a cause for eczma  psoriosis  these are factual and are in the wikipedia  as follows  this is very acurate information  this is true information and this parasite ascaris is a cause of both eczma and or psoriosis all i have done is join the dots wikipedia has the answers many sufferers are looking for  connecting the dots isn t allowed  i m afraid  it s called synthesis and is considered a form of original research  which is against our policies here  if ascaris is acknowledged to be the cause of psoriasis  it would be best to source this fact from an article in a medical journal or perhaps a medical textbook ,0

 obviously there is some anti americanism in canada  this means nothing  necessarily  with regards to the structure of this article  i was referring to the specific idea that canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed  or that canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to americans  and i asked for another side of the story  and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction  your response here is confusing  as far as citing my sources i am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article  not making additions to the article  several of your quotes are very weak examples  many countries could claim anti americanism on the basis of involvement in the middle east  that doesn t mean it s a relevant enough addition to put into the introduction of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world  that is meant to specifically talk about the major issues between two specific countries  as far as your sources go  you did not comment on the obscurity of them  you have still not properly defended james tagg  yes  that was me who removed that a year ago i don t see why you get to just dub a source reliable when i thoroughly explained why i determined it unreliable or  rather  inappropriate to add i read that source  left you detailed comments  and you said something like don t pov push and reverted my edits  you are not making an argument here re  culture clash in archive again  there are two sides to every story  please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article  many canadians would laugh at the idea that the usa causes a profound fear that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed  and why do students  opinions have so much weight  by the way but there likely won t be many sources to support this  because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldn t exist for a counter argument  nevertheless  i ll take a look one last time  this is about obscurity clouding neutrality  and onesideness breaching neutrality  i am not trying to say that what you re saying is not true at all  i m sure it is true the the extent that it is  but how much is that  the points in question fall so far below the relevance required to be in the introduction to an article  that they should be immediately moved  ,0

first  i just realized via your question that i could answer here assuming it saves yes  i finally get that my attacks were totally inappropriate and unneccessary  i confess i did not at first  even this morning  i realize i made inappropriate attacks after looking at his contributions and assuming some highly speculative personal motivation and then asking him about it in an offensive way  i would not be at all surprised if others have made negative assumptions about me based on looking at my contributions history and attacked me  so the user does have my sincere sympathies and apologies  what to do differently when groups go after me  write a better wikiquette name several people  go to wp ani naming several people  do user rfcs naming several people  that is where i admit i need further advice since a year old off wiki email is often the focus of harassment  and so far the advice is not to go into detail about it  i don t know how to defend the recurrent references to it  let me say again  it was a stupid  overly generalized and exaggerated response  but certainly not written with some evil bigoted intent  i feel that a lengthy correction of it complete with refs about then existing specific incidents issues etc  or stating in detail my current views  would be inappropriate  even on my user page and doubtless lead to more accusations by people who have a different pov but if there s some policy on this that i missed  i sure wish people would help me out with that ,0

 minor wording issue about steamboats i m doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence  from the navigation section  the use of steamboats along the river  beginning in there is a footnote  to this timeline page  which phrases it steamboats columbia and lot whitcomb begin regular service on the columbia river  the thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before at least to fort vancouver  the first was the beaver  steamship which arrived at ft vancouver in i thought about rewording the sentence the regular use of steamboats along the river but that isn t quite right either because the beaver was in regular use even if its operations were not limited to the river  anyway  i can t come up with a way to reword this bit  especially given the existence of the footnote  which does not mention the beaver  so i m just mentioning it here  it is a minor point to be sure  but symptomatic of an unfortunate us bias present in many history books and web pages  ,0
 the band s legacy  beggar s banquet  etc  an anonymous user is repeatedly misreading the guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it here s the direct quote the spark for fairport taking this watershed turn was the band s album music from big pink  the record that along with bob dylan and the band s basement tapes bootleg brought about a widespread musical volte face  in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness  among the rock aristocracy  its influence was evident in the beatles  ill fated back to basics project let it be  the rolling stones  purple patch that began with beggars banquet  and eric clapton s decision to call time on cream the anonymous user takes issue with this statement  claiming that music from big pink could not have influenced beggar s banquet because of chronology  i e that the stones were almost done recording the album when big pink came out but  read the statement  it does not say that it influenced the recording of banquet  but the purple patch that began with etc this seems clear to me i would like to hear some other editor s opinions on this matter thefortyfive  ,0

 so jezz gets to personally attack  assume bad faith  and violate wp policy by removing chunks of material from my own comment in an article talk page  gotcha  i do not accept your decision as valid  fair  or equitably applied i only wrote on jezz s talk page because he was violating wp policy and insulting me and undoing my comments on the article talk page  and ignoring and disrespecting all the work and good faith presentations i made on the article talk page  you agree iwth him removing chunks of my comment on the article talk page  though wp does not allow that  you re facilitating bad behavior on his part by totally ignoring it  or not seeing it  and singling me out in this matter  very wrong did you even read what i wrote on your talk page i m not saying i was necessarily totally perfect in the edit situation time line or in my tone on the talk page  my point  sir  is jezz has been far from perfect himself  and has definitely violated wp policy  yet you won t even see it  or get on him for it  or block him for doing all this  you notice i did not personally attack doug weller or tgeorgescu  why because they were civil and cool  and you never gave me a full chance to even defend myself on the notice board page  so i don t agree at all with your action  jezz has been unquestionably out of line and you don t see any of his stuff on the article talk page  or the nonsense and bad faith insults and accusations and negativity he hurled at me left and right why is that ,0

  so i hope you will oppose any version of fr that would not have prevented this case  as not being fit for purpose  in just the same way that a retraction will be due from jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have prevented the ted kennedy incident i hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is thankfully relatively rare why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as flagged revisions is not very appropriate at all  i contrast it as the british government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card  on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists  which happen to also be thankfully relatively rare why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach  and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word molesting instead of forcing onto all blp articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure and any interested observers  please  stop before you say it  these valid concerns with what fr is could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant  advantage  of fr of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles and to further address the specific example you give  maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim  when it was added to the article along with another sentences  which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax  and at worst  screams delete me now for being total wp bollocks  we can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal  fixes the article for typos without noticing that it is complete bollocks  even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag  a systemic failure perhaps and finally  as an admin  perhaps you can tell me why the ip user is not now  block irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred  incidentally  the now famous bad account on ted kennedy was also not  block  imediately after his first edit was a blp violation on an unrelated article  another systemic failure i m all for criticla analysis of cases  fr would have prevented because they frequently pose more questions than they answer  about the whole model of wikipedia  never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent blp violations  ,0

 question for agk hi agk  you mention above that arbcom is anxious for nina to submit her evidence so that others can rebut it  nina didn t open this case  lhvu did  he alleges that  there is a sustained and possibly co ordinated campaign to have the wikipedia article reflect the pov of the anti stratfordians providing potential authorship candidates  and one in particular presently  an enhanced  preferably equal  standing within the article to that of shakespeare why is the committee not anxious for lhvu to provide his evidence  so that whomever it is that he s accusing of engaging in this conspiracy can rebut his accusations bishonen has called for nina to be banned for at least a year  why is the committee not anxious for her to provide her evidence so that nina can rebut it if i were you  nina  i d sit tight and wait to see what evidence  if any  is brought against you or anyone else  as things stand  there is no evidence  and no case to answer  ,0

thanks for the response i understand how to use awb  and i ve seen many useful edits with it  as you describe but i don t understand  why line breaks after section headers  specifically  need to be undone is it something built into awb that you are agreeing to because it prompts you  or is it something you added for a particular reason the reason i m curious is because i see people  such as myself  add a line after the section header in the edit window all the time and it seems inefficient if there is a guideline in the mos or somewhere saying otherwise  thanks  tree,0

 kane s secrecy  quote from the article if the allied campaign were to be completed in red alert  the allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of red alert it should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original tiberian dawn manual  which states that nod is an african group in its origin  making no mention of the soviet union whatsoever  if the instruction manual was written by gdi  then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of nod were maybe kane planted information stating that it was from africa  or maybe it really was from africa  and kane s attempts to drum up support in the ussr were unsuccessful regardless  it doesn t seem to conflict  especially if it could be established that the manual was a gdi document  and therefore biased and uninformed please go and look up the meaning of the word fiction sometime either by clicking on that hyperlink  or by visiting an online dictionary the sooner the better  to be perfectly honest  as an aside  the changes to the section you indirectly are proposing would  trans late to a classic example of original research the section s current content is sourced through the referencing of several different publications and statements of various c c  development teams  rendering it fully verified  ,0

as far as presenting sources are concerned  the book the life and exploits of alexander the great  sites much more sources in detail than source  which i think refers to some sources already referred by others  as such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher  its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps  perhaps not  as far as the author is concerned  in my understanding  he himself suggested that the story of alexander that originated from egypt should be considered more authentic than others reasons given as it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history  whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat  to these countries  then  we must not look for the original alexander story  similarly  we must not look to the states of greece for it  because at the death of alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples  one country only could be the birthplace of the alexander story  and that country was egypt i am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i e  keeping the alexander story from egypt as authentic  which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources  especially ones from greece that perhaps dominate current understanding this according to me  forms one of the essence of the alexander story  and i hope someone clarifies which story is the egypt story in the said book which i myself is unsure for i don t have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off egypt origins  at the most i can only hope that someone will research into the alexander story from egypt  and not his fanboy fantasies from greece  to put forth a credible understanding if not already done  then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here ,0

  shmayo i already know the map from john speed  but this far away from being an evidence that the suryoye suraye called themselves assyrians or considered the ancient assyrians as their ancestors  the deutschen don t call themselves germans  germanen  or alemanes  alemannen  in their native tongue and it s not the first time that the word suryoye suraye was mis trans lated into assyrian by outsiders missionaries and colonists  do you have quotes or chronicles from nestorian christians before the th century and in their own words  which shows an ethnic assyrian continuity  the syriac orthodox church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back  where they equate suryoyo with oromoyo in their own words  interestingly  the arameans from maalula who are either christian melkites or muslims call their aramaic language dialect also siryon or loghtha siryanoytha aramoytha which is a result of greek christian influence on the arameans  the word suryoyo  which literally simply means syrian in english is rather a religious term similar to maronites  catholics or melkites  nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history  even if the word suryoyo derives from assyrian ot doesn t change the fact that the arameans where also known by this name  ,0
 managing the content of articles when a plant product  whether food or other  is not in a relationship with botanical taxa is always a problem  here it seems clear that a separate article on the plant product is the right approach  there s bound to be some overlap with genus species articles  this article seems to me about right in its focus on what english speakers normally mean by banana namely the food  where it comes from  what it is  how it s grown  etc  it would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to musa  genus  perhaps  with some cross referencing  so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic  but this would be a marginal change  ,0

 viriik so vote on a consensus on a questionable and corporate watchdog site  the problem is that you are giving more validity to a person managed website that is hardly corroborated than a credible site like global security  federation of american scientists  cnbc  yahoo that website does not belong on the site i would accept controversy but the problem is that it needs to be corroborated you can t put a website that accuse dick cheney of a secret plot against the president based on a site like rense for example you want to support lunancy this isn t your soapbox to do so ,0
 diverse views means editors with a variety of perspectives and general outlooks  experienced means the person in question has been around for a while  is very familiar with policy  and has some experience with related topic areas  with a bit more focus and structure with the involvement of a few experienced hands will make it much easier for uninvolved administrators to decipher what s going on and identify disruptive editors  if i can further clarify or answer any other questions  please let me know  ,0

 it was a positive review  i don t think you read it  you cherry pick one line over a is this neutral  milton s book is the third by a science journalist to question neo darwinism the other two being by hitching and taylor  both mentioned in the article  spanner further says he does not by any means cover the same ground as taylor milton also mentions this on his website about taylor being a science journalist and questioning neo darwinism before him  of course you wouldn t know this becuase you don t read books by milton  i have seen your edits on milton s page  you seem to be under the impression he is a creationist if you bothered to read his books you would see is is actually a neo lamarckist  milton has been misrepresented here is what spanner says about milton he writes well  forcefully and with conviction this book is well produced did you forget those bits  on a side note who is david spanner  hes a fundamentalist christian  who trained as mainly a physicist  he was not an expert on biology  he mainly wrote about thermodynamics and religion  of course he would of disagreed with some of milton s views becuase milton is non religious  here is douglas spanner douglas spanner ,0

i did not know that erbacan was also in the turkish government in in any case  every turkish politician is within the kemalistic ideology  since noone criticising or rejecting or judging this ideology  but they all accept it  taksim can as well have this link  the megali idea was not that simple as establishing a greek state that covers all the greeks  as u said  the greeks of pontus  southern italy  former southern serbia  modern fyrom eastern rumelia  alexandria  cyprus  where excluded  yes  megali idea shares similarities with enosis  that s why the link is present in that article  but adding megali idea and excluding kemalistic ideology from taksim  seems  at least weird  cause kemalism is much more relevant with taksim than megali idea could ever be  regards,0
 rename aussie film list index sorry  i m on the fence with that one index and resources kind of longwinded to me  difficult to get to easily  without redirection but i completely agree with you as to what the page is  it s partly disambiguation and not useful for much else except for the links  maybe also although controversial as to what to list  the page could summarise the influential films for that country in a concise list of around top films of notability or really made an impact on culture but then i guess that s what the cinema of australia article is for  yeah i m not sure about that particular title  but i think it might be better to steer it into something  maybe it should just be a disambiguation page and the links and resources might be better suited on the cinema of australia page ,0

  no seriousy the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that if i really had my way  half of you would be shot ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking  it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much  much better off if of the population died tomorrow that doesn t mean i go around killing people  or making specific death threats against individuals and don t you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says oh my god you are such a fuck  ing idiot just go die already that they probably don t want you to die  or more accurately they don t care very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people and i am not one of those people if you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person i am edit  which was on a wiki talk page  is probably not the best granted  nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like and and automatically assume that w hate ver is written is russian the cyrillic alphabet is used in many slavic languages  as well as central asian former soviet republics  and even mongolia so i called someone an idiot boo fuck  ing hoo maybe he could have said what language is that instead of assuming that it was russian however insulted he was by me calling him an idiot i can guarantee you that i was at least times as insulted by him calling that russian i am a proud  native russian  and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations your other example how i am a bad contributor is what  a spelling correction or was it the fact that my edit summary was how i felt about the sad fact that  nigger  s can t spell  don t even think about raising issue of my use of the word i live in harlem around here  that word is used like a comma and before you try to tell me the difference between  nigger and  nigger there is none it s called a dialect while for some purposes  it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them  i find it is usually clearer to spell properly also  a  nigger to me at least  is not a black person i am not a racist  i do not even draw distinctions between people  in my holy opinion  there is a  nigger inside of all of us people  like you  for instance  who take offense for no reason  i mean  was saying black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society  tarred and feathered  strung up on trees  dragged through town by their enormous wangs  etc  no and if that is what you heard  i d like to know why are you black of the black people i know personally use the word  nigger more than i do are why we as a society still can t get over the silly idea that words are harmful words are not harmful ideas are harmful one particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all you want to end racism forever stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word  nigger seriously i happen to be a priest  and a docktor and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities fuck  s like you make me  hate  it  but i still do it that s what a good person i am i forgot what else i was going to complain about i mean  i could complain about everything on wikipedia  not because i am uncivil  but because there are enough wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal  well adjusted individuals such as myself if you look at all my page edits  they were all good for the encyclopedia ok  there was one tiny exception a long time ago  i saw someone changed a caption on scottish fold to winston churchill someone else reverted it  and i reverted it back i felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image but everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content i may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong  but i only do what is right that is why i put it on my user page i don t do wrong things if you try to argue with me  you will be in for a world of hurt butthurt  to be exact but you have nobody to blame but yourself unlike you  i actually warn people first but no you fags have to be humorless  oversensitive  fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self importance and your administrative powers well you can go fuck yourselves  if you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas i joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better  and that was all i did but i guess you  cunt s actually enjoy bathing aro,0

 name of georgia i recently edited the section about the etymology of georgia to reflect the fact that there is no definitive theory as to the name s origin  my changes were reverted and now the section is back to the version with questionable assertions and weasel words  such as probably may be clearly presumably etc  it is not the prerogative of wikipedia editors to create a synthesis of different theories to reach a single probable clear or presumable conclusion  for this reason  i would like to rework the section in the following way  which i think is appropriate given the divergence of theories  any additions or suggestions are also welcome  ,0

 well  there was a hot war going on in the background of tyold  the konfrontasi the whole living dangerously line was based around sukarno s words ushering in of hot conflict against malaysia  uk  etc  but on the point of indonesian civil war at least at the beginning of there was indeed some combat between the g  s forces and those loyal to suharto  i m of the opinion that the period of combat was brief  and that after jakarta was seized by nasution suharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided hence  why the pki s central committee in exile called it just a white terror  but of course  however  the same group criticized aidit for not adhering to mao s people s war doctrine so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the pki that were spoiling for a conflict  hence  i titled it indonesian civil war rather than indonesian white terror or indonesian coup it keeps things npov and open to different scholarly interpretations by  i should point out that i have an interesting hard copy self critical document the pki central committee published from china detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in and attempts to re establish the party  unfortunately  it is without copyright information printed  this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the u s  cold war i am looking forward to contributing some choice quotes to round out indonesian civil war  at any rate  toodles  ,0

 great  but what i meant about weakest link is that i don t see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources i ve seen  have you got a source that place s something called post industrial in the context of the history of noise music i m presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the  post  tag unless the sources are good on this  it s too divergent  in my opinion  to include right now  some of what might be called post industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn t warrant inclusion  you might as well do a section on death metal and its precursors  but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward  especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as noise music personally  i think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music  or any composer artist  that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making  and i don t think that is what should happen with this article  unless the claims are sourced  and that s why i mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound noise in music have to offer  we now see a number of artists  for example jeff mills  being redefined as a post industrial musicians and the sentence throws in the year despite the fact that mills has been associated with techno for years now  i find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic  ,0

 this whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals  what we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color  by calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea  that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity  it has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color  that is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold  flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors  like all other forms of symbolism  to do this  thus  the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty  but rather a way to communicate  you dolt,0

hm  are you suggesting stripping discussion of the pentarchy in the lead or are you suggesting different phrasing  if so what do you recommend my understanding is that it was constantinople s position that rome objected to  which  granted was at the core of justinian s pentarchy  but not the idea of the patriarc hate  system as a whole  even so  though  it s not like rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time  in other words  it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements  some of which led to temporary schisms  but to my understanding justinian s system  even if not everybody liked it  became a practical reality  one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed rome further and further away  ,0

comment  cited academic works that have been vetted by peer review are not pov  and are probably some of the hardest forms of source to contradict  when i say peer review  i mean by those in academia not our own peer review process  your claims that they are an author s pov are spurious at best  the books he used are highly researched publications by noted members of their fields who spent years researching this subject you will need some serious sources to counter those presented by chris  also  before you go challenging his research  i wish to remind you of chris  bona fides  he is a published author who is finishing his phd in gastronomy from boston university  a major american university  you really need to step up if you wish to contradict his work  blah blah ,0

 i understand the confusion  you would think that since a primary source is a first hand account  it would be the most reliable  however  the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint  also  there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another  that s when a secondary source comes in  a secondary source s author is one step removed from the event reducing the chance of bias  and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion  evaluation  and or conclusion  furthermore  secondary sources are more likely to be published the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here  it helps us avoid original research  one of the biggest problems with wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions  whether intentionally or not  which would be considered original research  you can read more about why published sources are sought on wikipedia at wp rs and wp source  ,0

 something anonymous editing has given rise to  vandalism manifesto  pass to all wikians  vandalism is good  vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm  vandals do their thing all over wiki from frustration and hatred because incompetent editors who have no skills  no degrees  no expertise  usually no names  have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others  vandalism is a good and natural response to no lifers  as in get a life  who  do edits edits a year and who have actual watch lists of or more and are proud of it  these  jerk s deserve have their own pages vandalized  over and over as long as they are in effect  vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop  vandals keep no life editors  admins bureaucrats and stewards honest  or at least busy  reverting the reverts they get on their own pages  vandalism is good  it helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns  the culture of wikipedia is very very sick  and vandals are needed to cull the herd support your local vandal vandal god ,0

  is this a press release with her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses  wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world  widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers  her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname nuclear wintour i m sorry but that reads ridiculous and has no sources to any of those claims  who has widely praised her  who says she is important  and the word reportedly  reportedly by whom  where is a source for her nickname  is her pageboy bob really trademarked also the following she is the eldest daughter of charles wintour  editor of the london evening standard  her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era so she was a newspaper consultant  i find it hard to believe that her father a grown man  would consult a youth on how to make a newspaper relevant to anyone  where are sources for this  i guess i will start looking for sources and removing non sourced statements tomorrow  if anyone wants to help please help me  i have only read paragraphs on this wikipedia page about anna wintour  so i am wondering what else needs to be fixed  i will read more tomorrow well  you could have asked me  per the  template at the top of this page  everything in that intro is repeated often in greater detail in the article and sourced to the best of my recollection  the general rule is that we don t footnote something in the intro section unless it s an extraordinary claim  like the most the oldest that sort of thing unless that s the only place in the article it appears  see wp leadcite  ,0

 wait  you added this to the article for starters  this definition of erotica it is the depiction of  sex  acts  pure and simple has no citation who came up with this definition because it is pretty much a crock as far as i m concerned what about the notion of suggestion  which seems the major distincton between erotica and pornography by the definition you chose to attribute  a depiction of an individual in a suggestive pose  ie not a  sex  act is exempt from being called erotica while i respect the need for clarity here  i think this current definition misses the mark why not refer to a dictionary definition  and leave pov out of it thank you  ,0

 no  i will make sure that will be removed permanently i will not do this for awhile to avoid violations  but hope that someone else will consider and agree there is no reason whatsoever to put the late in front of his name  i will list several reasons  and although i think that is somewhat pov  there are other reason as to why i remove the info  everyone dies sometime does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put the late in front of everyone that has died  poor writing it s just sloppy filler writing to put the late in place would you ever see anyone referred to as the late in a print encyclopedia  recentism wp has a guideline template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective would it make sense years down the road to still refer to him as the late let s make things as static as possible  precedent at one point  several dozen articles referred to steve irwin as the late steve irwin now  this is the only one that does  by doing a search and there seems to be consensus about that  knowledge of his death let s face it  a vast majority of people  especially those that would look for this article  know he is dead  and the few that may not be sure can click the link maybe people don t want to know that he s dead or be reminded of it  and putting that acts as a spoiler even anna nicole smith had a few the lates put on pages of hers  and those have all been removed  a few by me  a few by others saving a click is not a valid reason for this  we should assume that the readers are smart  and things like that can go to the simple english edition  irrelevance why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming his shows will probably be reran for many years to come  and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming well  this is my case  i would also like to point out wp own  which i feel has been violated in these reverts i also am starting a discussion on wp words to avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that i am doing the right thing i am supremely confident that i am  and i look forward to improving the peta article in the future  ,0

 invitation to esperanza hey there if you have not heard of this place before  and might be interested  drop by with kind regards ,0
 danny your motives are clearly not about being more encyclopaedic as we have seen your methods time and time again  as the wikipedia page says you can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a url surrounded by single square brackets  this does not provide as much information to readers  but it is much better than not citing your sources at all interestingly  i see you have only attacked and vandalized the quotes website  and none of the watchtower s multiple links  no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops  as for the links to quotes websites  they are extremely encyclopaedic  and the page has no commentary  but lists all the printed material about so as to give fair and reasonable coverage  rather than just a few selective quotes  they are all given their source  publication  date and page numbers for proof and reference  your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the watchtower organization has written is very revealing  you clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn t suit your agenda  not dissimilar to your religious organisation  i suggest you look inside and see why now after many months  you feel the desperate need to hide accurate  comprehensive  dated  quotes  direct and unaltered that have been published by the watch tower society  if you can give all the publications from the watchtower s website  then i m sure many here will be only to happy to list that link  but i think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications  and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on you have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site  merely saying it s not useful is a deadpan pov with no basis but your own fear of reality  and your desperate urged to manipulate the public  posted central august ,0

trevithj the reason sources discussing the negative feedback amplifier do not mention set points  errors  and comparators is that they have no more relevance than the stock market the remarks of black are perfectly clear and also make  no mention of these factors  nor do his patents  they are understandable as he intended them  the use  of feedback bypasses  the  inadequacies of the nonlinear  variable  and uncontrollable properties of the large gain open loop amplifier  as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closed loop gain to be set at as fixed by a resistor divider  for example  by making the closed loop gain  independent entirely of the open loop gain  i don t think you fully appreciate the simple algebra that governs this circuit ,0

 i m pretty sure  i wish i could find more history about it  that the the toponym river plate is a relative neologism coined in the british empire  esp  in england  perhaps as little as a century or so ago you re surety is misplaced  the british have been calling it river plate since drake  with the barest minimum of research i counter your assertion with the fact that a book entitled a narrative of the operations of a small british force  under the command of brigadier general sir samuel auchmuty  employed in the reduction of monte video on the river plate  a d by a field officer on the staff  illustrated with a plan of the operations was published in see samuel auchmuty  ,0

  i can t quite figure it out  the system of numbering dynasties was developed by manetho in the thirtieth dynasty  so it isn t often applied to later dynasties  but it looks like the second period of achamenid rule  following the thirtieth dynasty  is sometimes called the thirty first dynasty  one might count the ptolemies as the thirty second dynasty  but i don t know if any reliable sources do so  they re either called the ptolemaic dynasty or the ptolemies or the lagides and counting them as number instead of would ignore the argead dynasty  alexander the great  his son alexander iv of macedon  and philip i arrhidaeus which ruled briefly but probably as long as some of the minor numbered dynasties  i can t see any reason for counting the ptolemies as number unless sources address the issue  i think attempts to give the ptolemies a number should be left out of the article  ,0

i don t have desperately strong opinions about what should be included other than the two most widely recognised songs of lennon s solo career however  it seems to me that anyone who does have such an opinion ought first to make the case for whichever song s  they want include on the talk page in order to gain consensus  if any can be reached on that understanding  does it seem reasonable to trim the paragraph and leave a note in the article to direct people to the talk page ,0

 the primary objective of wikipedia from  wikipedia exists for the people who read it  not for the people who edit it  every edit should either improve the factual accuracy of wikipedia or make it easier and more useful for the reader  any edit which does not serve these goals is a waste of time and energy  and quite possibly counterproductive adapted from beyond my ken it is not true that wikipedia exists only for the readers  editors have a role to play too should wikipedia become nothing but a bunch of quotations cut and pasted here and there besides  i am unable to think of any encyclopedia that is free from original research  furthermore  who made you guys the wikipedia police ,0

 you know what  forget it  the guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here  because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why  except of course to start shouting  has reported me for not being civil  how ironic is that  rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better  i ll simply point out that in the current version  even after you read the entire first paragraph  you still don t have a clue why this article exists  you do find out what marco rodr  guez does for a living though  so yay for that  i guess once you get to the end  you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal  but that s assuming you haven t fallen asleep  or shot yourself  having read the same four words brazil  germany  biggest loss  and their million variants multiple times  seriously  if people here think what s currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way  perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living  it s not quite garbage  but it s not good  and please stop justifying such poor dull repetitive trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are unencyclopedic frankly you couldn t be more wrong  there s no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match  both now and in years time  if you don t want it to be in this one  please think of a better reason than unencyclopedic if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean that said  on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article  here s what the opening should look like  if you re trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points  it s not perfect  but it s a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with brazil germany was the shock result of the first semi final of the fifa world cup men s international football tournament  played on july at the est  dio mineir  o in belo horizonte  brazil  it broke brazil s match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to and equalled their biggest margin of defeat  tied with a loss to uruguay in leading it to be described as a national humiliation  the game also saw germany score the most goals in world cup history  their overtaking brazil s their second goal meant germany s miroslav klose reached world cup goals  overtaking brazil s ronaldo as the tournament s all time record goalscorer  the game was subsequently referred to by the press as the mineirazo  evoking the spirit of the maracanazo in which brazil unexpectedly lost the fifa world cup on home soil to uruguay  ,0

dude  seriously you need to relax a bit  life isn t all about research and fact hunting  you went crazy when you saw a hoax page  and did hours of research into it  it was a blatant hoax  and it was just a childish game  which you got involved in  i hope you re happy that you spotted the hoax  but anyone could have done it  you even got your friend on the case to do research into it  i agree that wikipedia has no place for rubbish  but it s the administrator s job to delete the rubbish  i think at the end of the day  you ve got to have fun and researching about some fake person isn t the way to do it  i think to a degree everyone s idea of fun is different  but almost everyone in this world will agree that what you did wasn t it  i d prefer to play scrabble with arabic letters than research into a prank  if you want a debate then i ll be on my user page  i always enjoy having chats with you that is fun ,0

 my reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the nicosia discussion page l nicosia and discrimination against greek contributors and the greek character of the citydear salvio you have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently  block  me from editing the article on nicosia for a hour period may i draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely seb az seric  and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds there is a constant undermining of the city  s greek identity i e  whenever a greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army the greek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views  on the other hand  such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the illegal  yes illegal according to united nation referendums flat of the non recognised internationally illegal self proclaimed state of the so called trnc it is totally unacceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals  that strategically reached the level of administrators  deteriorating all the time the article on the city of nicosia  promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the greek character of the city and at the same time having an additional article on north nicosia that is depicting a totally false picture w r t the city  the trnc is illegal  not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terrorist states that are non democratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of cyprus  this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on northern nicosia stressing how turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city  talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the greek character this is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable greek character of the area controlled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour in the light of all of this  i shall stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self  furthermore  i do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totally biased and discriminatory marcobadotti  talk ,0
  so his summaries weren t as antagonistic so whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning good to know on to your second claim  i still don t understand how  i  have a pattern of edit warring  but olyeller doesn t when i added a completely valid and relevant and referenced sentence  and olyeller repeatedly removed it for no valid reason  and olyeller falsely claimed in his summary that the issue was presented in the talk page so it s odd that falsifying summaries isn t considered a form of antagonism and or worthy of a warning  the only reason olyeller removed it is because he has a really big anti carbonator grudge  i once called him a thin skinned prick and he took it badly he now confirms the validity of said appellation by obsessively searching for any of my edits and reverting them  which is exactly what he did in this case how is that not vandalism ,0

 request regarding current rfar clarification there is an open request for clarification regarding a sanction decided at wikipedia arbitration requests case abd william m  connolley  see live link  or permanent link  is the only arbitrator to comment there so far  i agree with him  and  unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised  i support the close of this request with no finding or clarification  my reason for this  it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at rfar clarification  and that i was  block  while this request was pending  for comments made in the request itself  is an additional impediment there is no need for extra debate or argument  i have stated that i am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which i interpreted the sanction  pending clarification by arbcomm  so the status quo is that the restriction is tight  though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who  block  me  i do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits  and i d argue that he did so consider  i accepted sandstein s decision clarification as a neutral administrator  pending arbcomm review  not future perfect s who was already involved  and i had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me i will continue to respect sandstein s tightening as standing and binding on me  and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated  and it did permit legitimate comment before arbcomm  when i am an originating party  as is normal  normally  i can  having filed  respond there to comments from other editors  also made there  which is what i did  arbcomm specifically allowed me to originate a case  and if i m clearly involved as well  i see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it i will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors  and i will avoid  in such a filing  if it happens  unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors  obviously  if i file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin  i will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required  which would only mention other disputes peripherally  and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues i hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual rfar than there has been to the existing rfar clarification  which  as it stands  includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material i filed  it s been pointed out by with clerk attention requested  and nothing was done  nevertheless  if the request is closed without action  it s moot  the real point here is that if clerks were following filings before arbcomm  surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved  and possibly the editor warned  ,0

they re describe themselves as conservatives not far rightists  you can t take one source  a newspaper  we all know that newspapers all have liberal agendas  and describe them as such  although i do sincerely believe they are a fascists bottomline is  they should be described as they describe themselves  not as one newspaper does  a journalist is just one man with one opinion ,0

march utc  yes  the presentation of god and cosmology in tub is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book  if one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way i can think of to describe it npov  npov though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship  origin and unusual  unique presentation that has caused various types of pov to surface in debate true  not true  religion  philosophy  etc  i searched in some online libraries  at the library of congress and even wrote to the urantia foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help  so far  i found it listed under scientific religion  religion  non fiction  cults  and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the loc  the book itself says it is an epochal revelation  which is the fifth to the planet  it describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding god  deity  and divinity  religious science  scientific religion  esoteric cosmology  religious cosmology  what  perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful  answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article  while increasing it at the same time  i think  what are your thoughts  you know if we wrote that the urantia book is an epochal revelation containing religio scientific cosmology  there would then start more pov debating ,0

  what vandalism jibba jabba  you have two  btw  what vandalism communicator kills patriots script logo can anyone upload the patriots script logo the duck super bowl loss the recent super bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the patriots franchise  the opening section discusses the dynasty status of the patriots  but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss  this page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important patriots facts  however  the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss  it is beginning to feel like a protected fan page  as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the patriots  obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by giants fans  but this page needs to acknowledge that the patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time dlomme yup communicator kills taunting disguised as factual information looking through the history of edits since the super bowl  a lot of information that s being added  and much of it since deleted  may be true  but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting is it really relevant that the patriots are the first team not to win the super bowl who cares and believe me  i m no patriots fan  they ve been a thorn in my team s side since last season s playoffs but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry  not a fan forum this page should be locked from any further edits for awhile  unless something truly relevant to the patriots should suddenly occur  actually  protection is not something to be taken lightly being an admin  and even though i am a die hard pats fan myself the level of problematic edits to this article  while high  is not so bad that we haven t been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos talk contribs far i ve nominated the article for featured article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere  protection this article is starting to get vandilized again  if it were up to me i would make it temporarly semiprotected  i wonder why vandilism is returning to it  get over it people  the superbowl s over  so you want me to request semi protection communicator kills bias the franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the patriots whenever a superbowl loss is mentioned  the opposing team and score are given when it gets to the part about the patriots winning superbowls not only are the teams scores not given  but it doesn t even say that they won them ie under belichick  the team went to three super bowls in four years  it should be consistant one way or the other the sentence  the patriots  however  were defeated by the new york giants in super bowl xlii  after winning the first games of their season  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section i think it warrants another sentence or or at least the deletion of the word howev,0

indeed learning curve  i am amazed at how much learning i had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operational first off  i wanted to make an iron clad security main page  like arbcom s wiki  that wasn t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in mediawiki s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files  generally images  in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with mediawiki merely typing a url path  that took some reading and trial error  mediawiki s excuse is that mediawiki is designed to be open to everyone  man  it s like about  openness the thing is  those who don t care to think about security  wouldn t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent url typing  however  those making a private wiki who do care wouldn t want them viewable by i p s and then thumbnails of images wouldn t work no matter what i did to localsettings php file  like many things  i would go to talk pages on mediawiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues  it turned out that imagemagick has been omitted from recent builds of mediawiki  moreover  installing imagemagick isn t a matter of dropping files and folders into the  wiki using ftp  it s a linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do that and  after all that is done  there are bunch of gotta have templates like template  xt  template template doc  template hilite  template nbhyph  template nowrap  and template xt  i think i have all the gotta haves now  i was the shepherding author sponsor on a bunch of them so i m fond of them i can t complain about  free  stuff  mediawiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under i ll take the poor documentation associated with open source software any day ,0

 maybe irrelevant wasn t the ideal word choice  i wouldn t remove a photo of a boston located school from the boston page  but i d be a bit skeptical of its inclusion  it s just that there are something like schools in the metroboston area  even if you limit it to the more notable ones  mit  harvard  bc  bu  berklee  emerson  suffolk  others i m probably forgetting  which one do you pick  you can t put an image for every campus into that section  so which one is sufficiently representative  also  i get the impression there s a minor status war between bc or bu  and probably other schools  regarding which one is depicted as the best school on wikipedia  so i think edits like the bc photo addition that could potentially be construed as marketing should be closely scrutinized  what do you think ,0

 silent letters the o in opossum is spelled but not pronounced  it is a silent letter  just like the h in the word honest  the articles a and an are correctly based on the first pronounced letter  not simply the first letter  so  you have the phrase an honest man not a honest man  even though h is a consonant  likewise  the phrase should be a opossum not an opossum  again based on the first pronounced letter  therefore  i will go through the article changing an opossum to a opossum  the o in opossum is no different from the h in honest  ,0

 i enjoy lacrosse and i am interested in unc lacrosse history and all the cool facts too  you guys have a lot of facts  achievements  names  tournaments and events  etc  it has been stated already  but just make sure to really sort those things out into categories or sections to make the viewer more satisfied to what they are looking at and reading  it s more of just a blob of information being thrown at me with cool facts thrown in  you can separate the tournaments like accs and ncaas and then list what happened or what awards were accepted  also  maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from  or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference  then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of unc lacrosse  could also have a section of unc s present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with unc lacrosse  otherwise  keep finding more stories and information about unc lacrosse and be sure to organize and really make it flow all together  in addition to that  don t forget to reference your sources at the bottom and after information you have found along with access dates and names  etc  keep it up and it will all come together great i m sure  unc lax get  er done  ,0

 well  i am not trying to pick a fight but i have npov issues with this article it reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress i have two problems  first  it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in  to science as a specifically western project second  although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge  the history of science is rather more complicated than that one way to deal with this  if others find my criticisms valid  is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge  from aristotle to bacon to comte to popper  from aristotle to darwin to mendel to mayr  from aristotle to newton to einstein and planck  etc  on the one hand  and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science  i e  issues in historiography and the sociology of science on the other for example  i think everyone agrees that aristotle  newton  einstein and planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but i think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims i d hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues  and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another i am no expert on this but i really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of  say  thomas kuhn and bruno latour  could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously  as well as the claims of those with opposing views i am glad ed has begun this article  it can be really important and it is a needed contribution  sr ,0

 cleanest city it is surprising that trivandrum is out of but  that surely is not a good ranking  like aarem suggested  being in the top deserves to be called  one of the cleanest also  cleanliness is not just about  clean it is about pollution  waste treatment etc  i suggest that  one of the cleanest  should be removed  best airport  i am not sure what this means  this tag was given well before the new terminal was inaugurated  i cannot understand how one could rate the old trv terminals as one of the best  if looks is the yardstick here most of the airports have modern terminals now and we should wait for a ranking of all the new terminals  also  the statement does not say on what grounds it is the best airport in terms of revenue  traffic  profits  passenger traffic  facilities  if you would like to retain it  please be more specific and of course have the references ready  cheapest and closest option i would suggest rephrasing this to one of the closest options to maldives and sri lanka and the only direct option to maldives  you can always use a connecting flight is what i am trying to say  for instance  someone in the uae can fly to colombo and catch a flight from there to mv mountainwhiskey ,0

dab said my impression remainst that the only reason this article is so long and detailed is the attempt to disguise from the casual reader the fact that the entire thing can be shrugged off in a one liner yes  that s probably true  but what is the alternative many of us have been battling to make the cmt clear  but every time a statement is made on how crazy the theory is  the other side asks for a proof citation and since that has happened almost every week for the last six months  and probably longer the article has grown in size i m not sure how we can overcome this problem  but i m open to suggestions ,0

 the removed paragraph  slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization  which happened mainly after the ausgleich  compromise of while no one now considers magyarization a positive trend  for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable  magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy  and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now  slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratic  i have removed this paragraph  not because i would necessarily disagree  but because this is a speculative formulation  a pov in wikipedia terminology  not suitable for an encyclopaedia  if this was an undisputed topic  maybe such formulations could work  but since that is not the case  it is definitely better to stick to pure sourced data  ,0

 response to third opinion request hi  i m here to give your third opinion i think it s important to keep in mind that this article is titled common english usage misconceptions it s not common english mistakes according to professional typography standards it is clear to me at least that the hypen is often misused there s no dash key on my keyboard i know how to make a dash  however but i do web dev and work for a printing company  and i just started a sentence with but and this one with and i know all these things are wrong but they are convenient and i m writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page so  in my mind  the question is whether this is a misconception  or just ignorance i believe that to properly call something a misconception  it must be believed to be a rule  when in fact such a rule is not correct i ve never heard anyone say  just use hyphens for everything it has only become the default  because we have no dash keys so i would lean toward excluding this entry  unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes  not just misconceptions hope this helps  ,0

 i was just released from prison on december during the period ending about november i engaged in a day hunger strike  actually and days started pounds  ended up an estimated pounds generally  i drank two cups of milk in the morning  and drank water as needed i was never force fed nor  oddly enough  was i ever hungry  or in appreciable discomfort i was examined  almost daily  by prison medical staff probably the reason that i did so well was that i understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body s electrolytes  calcium  potassium  sodium  magnesium  phosp hate and to consume just enough amino acids to supply neuro trans mitters if you merely drink water  after a couple weeks you ll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance  and you ll feel terrible most people attribute this to not eating  but i learned that it s actually due to the electrolyte imbalance  not the lack of calories  at the time  the longest hunger strike i d ever heard of was referred to in the capote book  in cold blood by perry smith  in the early s days i could probably have gone two more months  ,0

 i feel like i can t improve upon this interaction while not understanding from the people involved  the person i said it to and  who did the block hours after the conversation was over if as  said  that blocks are meant to be preventative not punitive  then i think its fair for me to ask questions about it to see where the situation went wrong  when i posted that message  and i still haven t heard from the block admin that its content was the issue  i thought i was making an attempt to improve upon the interaction with this editor by trying to speak with him on a sincere and personal  human to human  level and made the comment on his user page in order to make contact with the person  rather than having us both resort to the standard drawn out wiki procedures  so far  at least on wiki  that editor has had no reaction to what i said  while people visiting my page here after the block have had incredibly intense reactions  i just have to ask if its fair that i be punished so intensely for their reactions to what i said  especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions  and me only able to appeal on this page ,0

there are many inaccurate statements being posted here  far too many  i don t have time to correct all of them  the bnp was modernised by nick griffin and has no links to holocaust denial or  nazi sm  digging up or year old quotes is irrelevant  you can do that for all parties as many change their ideology  the modern labour party are not the traditional labour party  just how the conservative party are no longer traditional conservative tories  during the heydey of the british empire the conservatives were pro imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries  do you think the modern conservatives under cameron support that  another example  the green party in uk used to strongly oppose drugs  yet now they support drug use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession  trade and cultivation of cannabis  so they went from being anti drug to pro drug  the modern bnp has no links to holocaust denial  secondly  the comment about nick griffin and the raf bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti bnper s  what nick actually said is that the raf should not have bombed german innocents  children and woman  as many were murdered in the bombing of dresden  likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent british civilians by the  nazi s  also the last claim modern bnp members sieg heil  i presume was a comical claim  it has no basis in fact  bnp are strongly against  nazi sm and fascism  if you want a real fascist organisation that would be the uaf  unite against freedom who attack bnp members with clawhammers and other weapons etc  is that democratic  you might not like someone elses political views but that doesn t give you a right to go out and attack them violently ,0

captions tell the history of an aircraft if you are going to have a picture of an aircraft then you need to tell its story and background this is only common sense if not for readability then for accuracy in reference  if you were to google f this article is one of the first to be found so this make accuracy and completeness essential in these article  and it does not add too much more in size if wikipedia was a dictionary then a simple caption would be ok but tbut wikipedia is more then it is becoming a valuable reference tool as such accuracy and details is essential,0

you reverted me and gave a reason when i called it external links  i reverted you and gave a reason again  i don t see the dispute  now  if you read verifiability  self published sources are reliable published sources at the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites  weblogs  blogs bulletin boards  and usenet posts  which are not acceptable as sources  rare exceptions may be when a well known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name  even then  we should proceed with caution  because the information has been self published  which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact checking so if the person who wrote this can be found to be an acknowledged expert in a relevent feild  then it can be a reference  if he has not  then it can not  simple ,0

external links you are currently engaged in a revert war over a link that you have not made a single arguement on the talk page to justify or remove  wp el does not require the link to contain information not in any other wikipedia article  but to contain information relevant to the current article that could not be covered in it once it reaches featured article status  which cr does  cr provides a more detailed timeline then can ever be provided inside the article  and further that is shown simpyl by the existence of a timeline article  if the information in cr could be included in the article  we would not have a split off article obviously  so i ask you to participate on the talk page and use wikipedia guidelines and policies to make your arguement as it would be more pursuasive then simply reverting without explanation based on more then personal opinion and feelings  thank you ,0

  may utc as far as i know it has been stated that several universes do not fit into the actual accepted universe of wold newton which integrates with the dc comics universe thanks to alan moore  thus marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross over connections or with the exception of steven rogers and peter parker whose worlds do not clash with the dc universe chronology  as for star wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the wold newton universe  only star wars takes place in an entirely different future past element  basically a universe that predates that of the earth  and tolkien s universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm  the same applies to dungeons dragons  world of warcraft and warhammer  however the world of faeries is related thanks to king arthur and shakespeare as well as c s  lewis and hans christian anderson brothers grimm  harry potter s world also doesn t tie in to the wold newton as far as i have seen  and as for looney tunes and disney the only way they might tie in is through who framed roger rabbit which has as of yet to be linked  of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn t  the only reason i added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those universes or worlds were not present  perhaps it could be stated that although they are not accepted within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole  piecraft ,0

 so far nobody s reverted me so that gives me hope  meantime  let me pick your brain on a broader related issue  in recent years  wikipedia has likely gained in importance as a vetting tool for employers  clients and others considering doing business with someone  naturally  the one doing the vetting has the lion s share of responsibility in judging an entry s reliability and supplementing it with other research  that said  do we bear some degree of ethical obligation to researchers to ensure an entry presents  as far as possible  an accurate  well rounded picture of the subject  in the case of ms  caesar  i was concerned that universities or other organizations looking to employ her and or give her some sort of public platform would come away with the impression that nothing about her merits further scrutiny  what are your thoughts ,0

 musings hey friday  while  block  the past two days i read through your subpages  things like  admin etc they are great i m burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i ve received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me  i also saw that i m not the only one who s been on the receiving end of this  i ve seen it all but its too long to go into here i m not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven t spent the time to look into before  mere editors really have little recourse in this  filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past  it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out of line editor  filing against an admin would  i assume  be much  much worse  admins seem to behave like inner city police with their wall of silence a lot of your comments show that you ve noticed the same happenings in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably but i am pessimistic that will happen  i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies  we need to define what something like disruption is  when someone is  block  for a personal attack  the diff should be included  that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change  we ve tried the trust admins to do what is right it has failed  ,0

 and use the confusing  redundent  yet common phrase north america not refering to the continent  either of two reasons  a desire to place the united states last on the list  by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the fair use of alphabetization to make the us hard to find  simply an oversight  well  nobody replied so i renamed the section on territories and regions to u n  subregions  it s amazing that this list puts the united states last  even though it has most of the people and of the area  is someone trying to de emphasize america s importance no it s just in alphabetical order  talk about  any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively canada and the united states yes  in the  human geography  section  namely the  rd paragraph other related terms are also treated in that sxn  talk central americans are not north americans  we are own people and we are not northerners we are seperate from them and are nothing like them  you can try to correct me  but the people who say that we are north americans are white folk who try to keep us down  and sometimes other ignorant groups of people i will never surrender to being north american and nor should any other central american should ever buy into this i don t care what the white man tells us they re not us we should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be this is just another way of bringing us down i am proud of being central american and being someone who inhabited this land long before the white people made contact with us if we have been living here for the longest time  should it not be us who decides who we want to be  tito a  mart  nez this is a lovely essay  but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling central america happens to be located in north america  so central americans are north americans it s a geographical thing  not a cultural thing  perhaps you re thinking of latin america and anglo america actually  tito can undeclare himself if you ll check the spanish wikipedia articles on central america and north america  you will see that spanish language defines north americ ass outhern most country as mexico  es norteam  rica redirects to es am  rica del norte  which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order  greenland canada united states mexico note that central america is not on this list wilyd is also right  as far as english language goes  north america includes mexico and central america  i think america  terminology  should provide a better explanation than it currently does  a section on english vs  spanish terminology would help i don t speak spanish  but i studied french in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning  maybe i ll recruit some bilingual wikipedians to help me write this okay  but i ll claim the fatal flaw here is this am  rica del norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term north america tito may not be a norteamericano although i don t think he declares himself here either doesn t spanish have an equivilent to l academie but he s still north american  actually  i don t think north american is an identity that applies to latin americans  his country  if it s in central america  is a part of the north american continent  but the cultural division is what he s concerned about  want to help me update america  terminology i think america  terminology  reflects correct english usage maybe use of the word american is a better place to move these kind of complaints  although i m actively involved in that article  and know it ll get shot down as original research roughly speaking  there aren t political continents wikipedia has articles on anglo america  not that i m convinced the term exists  in contrast,0

 recap i decided to withhold further comment until i had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision  i am delaying a trip this morning so that i can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion your supporting statement for deletion is as follows the result was delete  the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm  and that the references do not support the notability of the subject  despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment  these arguments were not clearly refuted  the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic  and i have counted those opinions as being from user julie dancer  kevin  talk as for the deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm  in reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist  namely examples of relevant works are a fast  bottom up decision tree pruning algorithm with near optimal generalization and an efficient algorithm for optimal pruning of decision trees which are capable of performing the function the article title names if this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion in anticipation of these other algorithms being added i immediately changed the body of the text to read the algorithm used for this purpose  to one algorithm used for this purpose  since i do not now have access to the article s history as the result of your deletion i can not give you the exact date and time  however  it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion incidentally  it has been suggested by a professor at cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history  normally as a wikipedia user i would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the wikipedia was setup this way  the wikipedia still claims to be  the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit  the impression i have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them  they simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed  instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection  especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves  as for  references not supporting the notability of the subject you can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment  these arguments were not clearly refuted  all of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which i deferred  just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it  i know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains as for the use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic this shows you did not read or comprehend the response i made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it  i explained that each of the user names were created so that i could track the use of my own resources better  similar to the need on the part of the wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user  eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots  but currently i am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the wikipedia and mining it off line since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w,0

 just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone  and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail in some cases it is probably appropriate  and actually used just like a surname  in a legitimate but different  broader sense than that used by our surname article  and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere  by the person that s probably especially true of radio personalities with an on air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name  i ve seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names but as a general rule  no  some like ann margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen  the problem  of course  is that our articles  especially the stubs and sub stubs  often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on if it is mary lou or something of the sort  common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname  especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself  it should clearly be under m in any category  the redirect which should be there  or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page  could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories  and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful but in between  there is a huge variety that you ll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories  and there are lots of them  even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn t even appear in the article s own name  ,0

 npov dispute just so this isn t lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one  here is a minor sample of the current npov dispute over this article  in my interpretation  the early october version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrase s usage  and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre  more mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed  the article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a conspiracy theory is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre  also  generally and commonly considered in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for npov  the new version of the article seems to be saying a lot less than the old version  we should go through the diff line by line  did someone ever justify those massive changes  though some of them were good t  ,0

 response to the disappearance of madeleine mccann  i reverted your edit because you give partial information  not because of the  wording i prefer  what parts do not make sense  the ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group  stop saying it is bad english  if it was just that you d fix it without removing information  garcia added that when the pj is criticized then the british police are also criticized because of their close cooperation what you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the portuguese article it is not just close cooperation  it was created a joint working group right from the start with the british police  this is why the british police are also criticized  just close cooperation they have with the interpol  the europol and other police organizations  no working group was created with them  i hope it is clear several unfair critics were made to the  methodology used by the portuguese police  garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by portuguese and british police other facts indirectly related to the different methodology personnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as forging evidence he  gon  alo amaral  was the victim of personal attacks by the british media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman  but also attacked him as a human being portugal has unsolved cases of missing children under including madeleine in spite of all the resources available and the different methodology  the uk has unsolved cases of missing children under in the last four years  national missing persons bureau it seems that the british  methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases  besides this the uk has a serious problem with child trafficking a serious problem with african children that just go missing no criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the control risks group  hired by the mcanns since may  the investigation  of the pj we ve stated all along  has the most likely chance of us finding her something made them change their minds the use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies  portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with children s abduction and trafficking that the uk has i hope it was clearly written and the parts of it do not make sense start to make sense  i am going to revert the edit  you are welcome to correct any bad english not the information  i am sure my portuguese is better than yours  ,0

the definition for fundamental attribution error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms psychology that is included in the definition  i would maybe replace words like attributor and add examples after both situational factors and dispositional factors i e situational factors such as luck  compared to the fundamental attribution error definition that was provided in quotes  the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow  though social perceiver may have the same problem as attributor did like i mentioned above  maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words  i e change social perceiver how an individual would be able to take in information to explain events instead of a in the real world i would use to one instance of this would be in order to have more of an encyclopedic style using their instead of his her before personality may be better as well  followed by in which the individual is interacting instead of he she is acting this would go well with the next section where individual and their is used in the place of he she and his her overall  i thought that this was a really interesting article and i think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples  i really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate  aside from the few things that i ve mentioned  i think that someone unfamiliar with the topic could get a decent grasp of the subject based on the information that you are presenting ,0

we do present the whole picture of a season here  the question is how much detail is suitable for wikipedia  car launches are trivial  do we also want dates of driver announcements  engine deals and there is basic information about testing  or will be once someone writes it for this page  so readers will know about the official tests  remember that previous articles in the days of free testing  the more recent complete ones anyway  do not give any information on private tests  so the editors were cherry picking information to begin with  out of interest  what more would you even write for testing  times  no  of laps  we all know they are meaningless  so it will even be somewhat misleading to include that level of detail  as for stats tables you mentioned above  they were simply a duplication of existing information ,0

 ndp affiliated i added a fact tag to the four times reinserted modifier ndp affiliated to the mention of bill tieleman  other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation loyalty  nor are publishers such as canwest  which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the bc liberal party  also one of the party s major financial contributors it s not that tieleman isn t an ndper  but his credentials go beyond his ndp politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party  also i m responding partly  also to  http en wikipedia org w index php title christy clark action  historysubmit diff oldid this edit by i ve puzzled long and hard over my own real world coi on bc political articles  but i see no reason to recuse myself from participation in bc political arti cles  though generally i give them as wide a berth as possible  but when i recognize pov political activity wording  as a responsible wikipedian i can t not say something about it  or challenge the povism and coi spin edits when i see them my interest here is to prevent wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p r  machine  of any party and to make sure wikipedia principles are observed particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect wikipedia guidelines or concepts like wp npov in the case of this item about bc rail  there s lots missing  including the search of the clark marrissen home during the opening of the investigation  and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming  and why no warrant was needed vs  all the other highly suspect irregular warrants to do with that case but there s also lots of other commentators  particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated  but also notable bloggers indepednent reserachers like sean holman  laila yuile and bc mary who have similarly spoken out about clark s involvement in the bc rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public  and of the informed media she may have been out of teh way for the hst fracas  and the big media have pronounced her clean of that but he big media also have maintained a veil of silence over bc rail the current text says that she resigned for family reasons  but it s well citable  that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the bc rail affair and about the tieleman thing  unless every time conservative affiliated columnists or bc liberal affiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims  often false it s not fair to single out tieleman for this  that s the reason for the cite tag  tieleman s own byline says only bill tieleman is one of bc s best known communicators  political commentators and strategists  bill writes a politics column tuesdays in hours newspaper and the tyee online magazine  bill has been communications director in the b c  premier s office and at the bc federation of labour  bill owns west star communications  a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour  business  non profits and government  and frankly  seeing whats going on with the ndp and teh things the party council james supporter types have been calling him  he may not be ndp affiliated much longer  ,0

 i ve come across variations on draughts  as i ve always called it we had a compendium of games that came in a cube it had six sides on it  one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on with draughts  apart from the traditional version  there were the following variations dammspiel that s what the manual called it i think it s also called damenspiel you set them up a bit like chess  but they were placed one square forward  hard to explain the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts diagonally  one square i think the kings could move multiple squares a bit like the flying kings rule people have mentioned except that you stop short of capturing my memory is hazy on the issue turkish checkers similar set tup to dammspiel damenspiel it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces  the set up being on the same squares you d use for draughts pieces move one square forwards  and  if i remember rigtly  capture diagonally  like standard draughts the kings  i believe  move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line again  my memory is hazy regarding the rules one game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names arrow draughts  dagger draughts or kings played similar to standard draughts you play it corner to corner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger you then play it like regular draughts i have played draughts with at least three opponents a relative  somebody at school and somebody i once shared a house with and they were convinced that a single man can t take a king apparently  according to this page  that s the rules in italian draughts  ,0

 color b  coldplay exp  rt let s talk  this talk page is for discussing the article  not world war ii history in general  summary of consequences i believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events  and in a summary article  one must summarize the consequences  my edit  stating that as a result of the franco british action on czechoslovakia  the molotov ribbentrop pact was signed is a factual statement  this is not stalin s arguments this is not a soviet apologist stance this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event  in the spanish civil war the red army fought side by side with the abraham lincoln brigade  prior to the franco british assisted  nazi  sudetenland grab  relations between  nazi  germany and soviet union were icy  when the  nazi s were declaring war on czechoslovakia  the ussr was hard at work putting together an anti  nazi  coalition  only after seeing the british and french backed down in the face of naked anti slavic aggression  did the soviets begin to look for other allies  there is no mass conspiracy here  as the search began right after the event  this is not a motive  it s a statement of facts  if there are no more objections  i will reinsert the statement into the article  as it is merely cause and effect  respectfully disagree  the statement as a result of the franco british action on czechoslovakia  the molotov ribbentrop pact was signed pretends to describe a casual linkage  although in actuality  the linkage was not so obvious  and the scholars  opinion on that vary dramatically  one school thinks that the only and sincere soviet union s desire was to establish a collective security system and an anti  hitler  s coalition  another school believes that the only stalin s aim was the alliance with  hitler the third version  the most reasonable  in my opinion  is that the ussr was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most european powers  that was  at least partially  justified and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers  and  to expand its territory the statement you tried to introduce into the article is a pov of the leftist part of the first group scholars  we cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events  we have either to tell a full story  that is impossible because of space limitations  or to abstain from any interpretations interestingly  your statement may be even simply incorrect  because  according to my sources hitler  s occupation of czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the ussr  uk and france  and could lead to signing of anti  hitler  triple alliance  in only a month after occupation of czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks  had chamberlain and stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other  and had ribbentrop been little bit less active  wwii could be prevented re this is not a motive  it s a statement of facts  no  all these facts had already been in the article before your edits  your wording looks like a description of motives  not statement of facts if you still disagree  try to propose another wording that takes into account all what i wrote  in addition  a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article  try to follow this unwritten rule  that saves a lot of time and efforts  as there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of world war ii and wikipedia s guidelines require that all non fringe views be given equal weight  it isn t feasible for this high level article to discuss casual links between events  what nick said  also the ussr wanting to be neutral argument falls apart  because historical evidence clearly shows that had france honored its alliance with czechoslovakia  ussr would have intervened as well  ussr secured a passage from romania in order to assist czechoslovakia  ussr placed all of its divisions west of the urals on high alert  after the seizure of czechoslovakia  the ussr held the uk partially responsible  and frankly did not trust them  or the french  as allies  if france failed to uphold their defensive treaty with czechoslovakia  why would a defensive treaty with ussr,0

 a problem with english patriot man and his sockpuppets hi  lately i ve seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named english patriot man i see that this man is nearly obsessed with polish people  he seems to spread his anti polish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning world war ii nazi sm in europe and racism against poles  he is totally denying the sufferings of the polish nation thank you so much for taking care of him  and taking care of the articles that are his main targets  however  now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place  so that his personal data and ip address would be totally different  this is why i suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like racism in poland racial policy of  nazi  germany  war crimes in occupied poland during world war ii nazi  crimes against the polish nation  invasion of poland  collaboration with the axis powers during world war ii nazi sm and race  untermensch  master race  white supremacy  racial hygiene  nuremberg laws  aryan race  aryanization  aryan paragraph  honorary aryan  white nationalism  holocaust victims  racial segregation nazi  germany  persecution of black people in  nazi  germany  occupation of poland polish decrees  kidnapping of children by  nazi  germany  forced labour under german rule during world war ii  extermination through labor  anti polish sentiment  anti slavic sentiment  polish question  polish joke  ahnenpass  anschluss  lebensraum  rassenschande adolf hitler nazi sm  racism  scientific racism  themes in  nazi  propaganda  germanisation  reverse racism  relations between  nazi  germany and the arab world  glossary of  nazi  germany this guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about poles being percieved as subhumans or non aryans by the  nazi s  in fact the only aryan looking poles that were accepted by  nazi  germany at the time  were kidnapped as children and underwent germanisation they were like of the whole nation  the rest of the poles were insufficient to be a part of the  nazi  ruled nation  and were treated only slightly better that the jew s this guy  he spreads lies all across wikipedia  therefore i thank you for your quick and effective actions diannaa  if you d need any kind of help in restoring the data which english patriot man destroyed  just tell me  i will also try to patrol the articles about poles  ,0
sir  my meager edits were factual  direct authors  quotes and in context  doc s edits were and remain out of context and reflect that he never read the articles he is mentioning  which puts the procedure in a negative light  i am sorry to ask but have you read the information to see the actual facts  vandalism by the wiki definition speaks to the repetitive introduction of inaccurate information for no constructive purpose  please review my posts and show me what was inaccurate or out of context  i am not afraid to admit when i am wrong  i have had a number of physicians and lay people review the history and they were also amazed and dismayed  as i was  you need to stop making this personal and focus on the published facts  otherwise wiki as a resource is doomed  finally  i am the just the last in a long line of contributors  both individuals and corporations  that have questioned his motives and accuracy  questions make many feel uncomfortable  i have also privately shared my exact written comments to doc with some colleagues both in the us  the eu and canada  and i was told by everyone that i was spot on sorry again for all the trouble ,0
 good policy suggestion on class assignments  my sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry  i think your  looks like a good idea  and i support it  it s especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced  thoughtful edits to psychology articles here  as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view  keep up the good work  talk  an appology is in order dear colin i am not sure if you will have the chance to read this  or if you ll have a moment to respond  but i am a student in the university of toronto and specifically one of the psychology students mentioned in the article however before i go any further  may i express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved  i will not try to make excuses for my actions  nor will i try to do so for my fellow students as i do not speek for them  i realise  and no doubt others will too  that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at u of t and most importantly  i realise that we did as future scholars was wrong i know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions  though i can understand where you are coming from  i do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the long run i see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides  but as a first year student i have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement  i am asking as both an avid reader of wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge  please do not black out our privaleges to use and edit articles let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits wikipedia and my school  looking to make this a better place civcodex thanks  we have no issues with people who are interested in wikipedia coming to edit wikipedia  what seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks  these students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate  talk contribs email if i write on your page reply on mine have replied on your talk page  talk proposed new policy i d like to advertise this  very draft  proposed new policy comments please  talk i think the central dillema is this  a student could make a poor quality contribution that harms wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit  if the grading rubric was accurate  a student would receive or negative credit  my personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment  increase their wikipedia knowedge  and improve the grading rubrics themselves  i m fairly proud of education program saint louis university signal  trans duction  sp which i helped write  you might want to ask there should also be some sort of policy re  how the community reacts to profs and students the active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies  in the first place  and we are often more unkind than necessary  in the second  i proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page as an example of the sort of implementation that i would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt  barnstars style border px solid gray  background color fdffe  rowspan valign middle rowspan style font size  x large  padding vertical align  middle  height em the barnstar,0

i looked at the vandalism page  and i have not vandalized the big o and dukes page vandalism is any addition  removal  or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of wikipedia  the most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor  page blanking  or the insertion of nonsense into articles any good faith effort to improve the encyclopedia  even if misguided or ill considered  is not vandalism  even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism  for example  adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism it s just not helpful  and should be removed or restated  not all vandalism is obvious  nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism  careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial  detrimental but well intended  or outright vandalism committing blatant vandalism violates wikipedia policy  if you find that another user has vandalized wikipedia  you should revert the changes and warn the user  see below for specific instructions users who vandalize wikipedia repeatedly  despite warnings to stop  should be reported to wikipedia administrator intervention against vandalism  and administrators may block them ,0
 as for the change in romanian to reich yes it is difficult to work out what caldwell is referring to  it seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in w germany  not polesti raf bomber command used an attack by the  af to attack this target  the days loses were as already given  specifically spitfire claims were not discussed  so the spitfire s percentage of the kill total is unknown  which is conveyed in the article more importantly  citations have been given for for the order of battle figures  your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable  oob are given in lists  as you should know  so your give me a quote tone is rather silly  caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given  he gives known strength returns  as for total german day fighter strength  again this estimated by caldwell  as strength returns for all years are obviously incomplete he points out  and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in september in the defence of central europe were available for operations at this time  while alone were available for combat in the west  german fighter units in romania in september were mixed in with eastern front units by june making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the oil capacity at this time  even considering that all e f fighters were at some point deployed in romania they only reach a combined total of compared to a total of plus for the other two fronts  negating even the med  theatre so your generalisation of a quote if this indeed is what it is  makes the bulk of the german fighter force concentrated in romania false  ,0

 narciso yepes please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about  yepes collaborated with ramirez  not bernabe  to invent his guitar  bernabe  an apprentice of ramirez  later formed his own shop and yepes subsequently played a bernabe string  as for your comment about yepes s hands  this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it  which was not to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think including string guitarists and clueless former students of yepes i have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available  depending on what best served the music  do you have these proofs no  so please stick to what you actually know fyi yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string s d together with the low g on the  th string by using the left hand thumb  again  we have the proof of this  it was even published in one of his old scarlatti editions  preceding unsigned comment added by your discussion at narciso yepes first  you added information that was not correct  except for the reason you gave for yepes s death  and it is not constructive to to add biased  unneutral opinions like yepes was the most notorious second  it is a well established fact that ramirez and yepes invented his ten string guitar  as i said  bernabe was an apprentice at the ramirez shop then  but the first yepes type ten string guitar was a ramirez guitar  moreover  ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d amor with multiple string resonators inside the body of the guitar  this was rejected by both segovia and yepes as impractical  it was yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only strings tuned a very specific way  c  a g f alongside the normal strings  you want a verifiable source  here  ramirez i  jose the ten string guitar in things about the guitar  bold strummer  pp isbn third  i clearly said yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings  f  or g  are very often played fretted rather than open  i have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact worthless because it disproves your ignorant  unconstructive  remark about yepes short hands being a reason for playing a string guitar  furthermore  yepes frequently uses the  th fretted  because it is the lowest string but not frequently the  th  as you mistakenly claim which is a minor  th higher than the  th string  moreover  these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non guitarist composers like ponce or rodrigo that are impossible on the string  except in the edited versions being able to use open strings as crutches for a lack of technique was certainly not part of yepes s entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar though  i will add  many ten string guitarists today  who are second rate guitariats in general  have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques  this has nothing to do with yepes s own performance practice on his instrument  as someone who has studied for over a decade with one of yepes s leading  long term  students  as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the string guitar  as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations  i can safely say that i know what i am talking about  yepes even frets a  and g on the th string rather than play them on the open a  and g strings and in an example i have in his own handwriting  and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely musical and not about any technical limitations  which exist only in your imagination you know nothing  ,0

the liber pontificalis is not sacred scripture  and not i but the source quoted said that the decree attributed to saint peter s first successor is probably apocryphal is anything else attributed to pope linus or was this the most important thing he did as pope by all means mention that the liber pontificalis is said to contain that information it was by oversight that i omitted the mention of the liber pontificalis  though the fact that i have no way of checking that the liber pontificalis contains that statement probably hd some subconscious part in my forgetfulness  the question of women wearing pants came to mind because of the probability that the decree attributed to pope linus is aprocryphal  the letter of pope nicholas i is certainly genuine i should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are  i think  less likely to go to mass wearing pants than without a veil  and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil if the pants question disappears from the footnote  i will certainly consider putting it in the body of the article by all means add the point that i regrettably forgot to mention  that traditionalists do not like women in pants at mass ,0

 dear wikinews  wikipedia  since conflict of interest neutral is an important subject since conflict of interest is being herald by wikinews wikipedia staff and volunteers  including being used by wikipedia wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article  story be deleted  and is grounds for action against a contributor  then please immediately provide documentation that editors  administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create  edit  supervise and or contribute for example  did any editor have  sex  relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia this is a conflict of interest  another example  does any administrator  editor or volunteer of wikinews and wikipedia including blackpearl svtcobra chris mann and whoville own disney stock  have gone to any disney theme park  watch disney movies and or buy disney products then blackpearl svtcobra and whoville and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in canada  or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits  have any connection to these products  places or businesses then this is a conflict of interest what kind of verification did wikinews and wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including blackpearl svtcobra and whoville don t sell disney products and have no business with the walt disney company and their affiliates as documented volunteers including blackpearl svtcobra and whoville together claim conflict of interest and delete any contribution in regards to pirates of the caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia  and control it by upholding double standards thus first we must verify wikinews wikipedia enforcement of their policy of conflict of interest and neutral wikipedia and wikinews editors don t follow wikinews  own written polices  do you know of an issue that has been forgotten then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy  and that wiki does not write old news  you even say one thing  and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion  you keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue  wikinews and wikipedia continues to uphold double standards  and then make statements with which to justify it incredible  you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims  and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims are you aware that wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well they proven that they have a network of supporting friends  using double standards  without following wikinews and wikipedia s own written polices  and such  wikinews and wikipedia allows editors fans to be bias  controlling w hate ver they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size copies of that have been documented as well  and to write articles that are one sided  promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause  yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don t approve from other people  and then justify reason after reason  such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest  not being neutral and such if they write or contribute it s against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete when in doubt don t delete and not to show respect when communicating yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it w hate ver you want to get your friends to sign off on your control if you don t abide by wikinews and wikipedia s own written policies  then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this  ,0

 environmental causes how can choosing to take less exercise and choosing to eat fast food be considered an environmental cause only if people are not responsible for their own actions that obesity is a disease according to some in the rich west is so that drugs can be prescribed  you cannot get a drug approved unless it is for a disease thirty years ago it wasn t a disease what s changed personal behaviour as the article says we eat more  we eat more rubbish  we exercise less doubtless there are environmental causes but what are they ,0
 skookum nd note  about the above there s situations  again with somena mentioned elsewhere  where the people and government are somewhat indeterminate and well as indistinguishable  in the somena s case because they re not a legal government  but one of the ancient social divisions of the peoples of the cowichan valley  what we might call a chieftaincy but that s an imposed concept  if you read the somena page you ll see what i mean i think bottom line is  frankly  we re imposing a rational order based on our concepts  separate concepts  of ethnicity  language and government  in some first nations culture that s a lot harder to do  so the somena are not a first nations government in the white man s way of thinking  or even in the thinking of the union of bc indian chiefs  which is an organization of whiteman system band governments and tribal councils created by the indian act  the reserve system  and government agents et al but it would be touchy to exclude the somena from equal status in a template  say  with their neighbours kin the quamichan all too confusing for a cultus whiteman at this hour of the night so i m going to bed now  ,0

 calling it the white stolen generation doesn t exclude aboriginals from being recognized  on the contrary it is the other way around  for example when the apology to the stolen generations was made was there any reference to white mothers or children  no there wasn t  only aboriginals and tsi were recognized  thus this is why the term white stolen generation was created to help distinguish it  even aboriginals recognize the white stolen generation by the following  after the apology to the stolen generation  indigenous leader max dulumunmun harrison  an elder of the yuin people  helped bring it out last november  when he wrote i applaud the prime minister s apology to our mob  but what about the white stolen generation that suffered the same fate  i know many white people who went through the same pain  so why can t this government do its healing again and apologise to the white stolen generation to bring closure to all this suffering ,0

 i have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic  after intervention of t  bel  here it comes dear val  who is also a mormon  or a parrots ain t sure i found very strange that each time i am answering to one wikipedian mormons question  it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to i do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you  nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you i think that the person concern  storm rider  is grown up enough to do so on its own unless next time i am under attack  you take the relay and answer that one for me as well  it could be interesting if you have something to say  say it so  but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit  as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don t know what to say so do the wisest  just shut up it is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed  and as you can see  repeating it indefinitely like rot speach  is not going to give you the ability to understand all you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and i am sure that you might see some light i do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction  more than a physical unhability to comprehend  expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept you cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit as for you stupid accusation of me not being  sophie  what about you  are you val  or are you rama  or are you dgl there is a lot of nick name on wiki  and all of them cover up a real name they are all a pseudonym  meaning they are anonymous so if i take the name anonymous as a pseudo  i will be as hiding and as showing as you are  because at the end  in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity so what are you trying to proove  except the fact that you were unable to figure what i just told you on your own i had a name  this name seems now to be unavailable  and i dont feel to make it again or take another following wiki rules all are equal on wiki  old rats as well as newbees  hahaha  and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian  thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience  and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition  so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality  who is wikis first rule it is all a lie how can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group it isnt equality it is power struggle it is adversity  and supremacy and group pressure as here wiki is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression  it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view  on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality ha ha make me laught  but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies please  in the future  avoid using words that you do not fully understand  as logic for your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously  do some research first i speak languages english  danish  french  german  norvegian  swedish  occitan  latin  greek  and geek of them fluently  the others as pocket use  like german i can read a book but i dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me weeks to get back the rythm as a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero  maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the us  but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages  in europe from age we choose between languages  english german and spanish  at age we have to chose another one  and choose between english german  spanish italian russian  from age when we begin graduate school  we have to take another one  and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american  and a dialect or local language  and can also take hebrew to languages are part of the compulsory pensum i also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia  and english dialect spoken in india that was for learning,0

 free software open source in many articles you show your intention to use the phrase free and open source the best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves  if you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term i have no objection  if the developers use free software it is best to use exactly that for that specific program  if the developers of a certain program use only open source and the license of the program is indeed an open source license  excluding the gnu gpl  its text explicitly uses the term free software then it s ok to use that description  the purpose is that the reader should not understand the word free to mean gratis in this case  unfortunately just using free alone makes it more likely that people will understand gratis if you software into that phrase free and open source something like open source and free software it would be better  ,0

 paul i just saw this or would for the final time have replied sooner this he said i didn t say knowwing full well what that you did say and do  is standard practice among the kathman reedy kennedey  rent a mob culture over at hlas they have exported it to wickie you have apparently drafted to play the role of formerly  alloted to  david tangled webb we both know that wilkins had already written a play  so there s nothing surprising about his then getting involved in a collaborative venture with ws  his other activities have no relevance to his ability to write  such as it was  where did you take your in logic  man actually wilkins had written in two produced plays but even then if wilkins collaborated on the globe version of pericles and there is no contemporary evidence that he unlike bacon  was regarded as a collaborator of shakespeare there is no way he could have got the job short of his old breakfast companion will s active intervention  haven t you read charles nichols or peter ackroyd on nichols yet you ll a lot better finding a mainstream than by hanging in there with kathman reedy and donald foster the former  say shakespeare is redolent of the brothel  here s the biographical link you guys have been looking for these past hundred years and you don t even thank me just yap yap yap  come back when you ve read curtius  ,0

thanks for the speedy reply and the links  after mining through about or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit  there are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor  as i mentioned before i still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit  perhaps in a table form  that can be added too  or removed  as needed rather than a vague catch all description for example  after reading the many of the discussions i can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldn t be done alone  aside from those the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights  i m not trying to beat a dead horse here but i just wanted to point out that the example you gave didn t really emphasize what you were trying to convey and if anything supporterted the opposition if they had bothered to read it ,0

army aviation i ve noticed you ve been adding a rather lengthy list of world army air arms to several such articles  this got me thinking that perhaps it s time to create a dedicated article on the subject  where we can also list those article  saving space in the national articles  there is a category at category army aviation  so i think army aviation  this currently redirects to military aviation  is a good title  any comments or ideas  perhaps there s a simliar article on one of the interwikis that can be  trans lated as a starting point  or used for sources ,0
 however  you didn t sign your edits  and in fact attempted to make them look as if they d been placed there in some official capacity  so that someone just looking at the page and not checking the edit history would not know they were placed there by a user who simply desperately wishes they were an admin  rather than an admin  please find some other way to fill the void in your life than playing defender of the wiki and making things personal when someone disagrees with you  because frankly  at this point  i care far less about the entry itself and more your despicable and infuriating behavior ,0
 another point i m trying to make is the trend that user is having  scanning specific articles and just deleting stuff all the sudden that has been there for a long time previously  don t band wagon if he s one of you  that is not the mature thing to do either  be unbiased and follow the rules of editing  deleting and dispute  wiki contacted  user reported  i am now personally resolving my contributions to the current three involved in this discussion  take care  ,0

 henrietta van laer says  no it s not that having an agenda at all is a problem for wikipedia  wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda  pro socialists  liberals  greens and  gay s  determined to vilify and demonize conservatives it is a completely biassed source  its articles on so called left wing parties are blatant whitewash while those on so called right wing parties are nothing but vilification  most of it based on flimsy third hand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact  instead of detailing their policies  wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice  the frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing  particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship  pov in wiki speak different pov to us  the wiki police i also get the impression that wikipeople are pretty young  there is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views  under conservative we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich  how naive can you get  i don t know what the term fat cat means in the usa but here in britain it has a very specific meaning i e  the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of times the average  naturally they are inclined to vote labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party  then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a right wing tax cutting party  many of them earn two or three times the average wage  and like the fat  cats  they get generous pension packages too  added to the votes of the millions of people who live long term on state benefits  this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honest joe workers or low paid  but wikipedia is still living in a world of student politics  with a poster of che guevara on the wall  his hair streaming in the wind  ,0

 after edit conflict with user jason potter the wp  rr suggests that the  th revert is the one not allowed  but also mentions that it is the spirit of the policy  rather than the exact letter  that is enforced  with regards to the section of this talk page ymous quoted  i did not miss that part  i also did not miss the sentence directly after it  which states this discussion page is only for discussion on how to improve the wikipedia article  in other words  the section quoted relates directly to the talk page  not the article  ,0
 i think the records section is a bit weird  for example consecutive championship titles with different constructors is not really his record  lawson did it first title with yamaha with honda championship titles with different engine displacement imo that s a bit of stretch  yes he won with the difference engine displacement but that was helped by the regulations changing  consecutive wins with yamaha in and i am not sure what exactly does that mean in he won consecutive races and in as well  ,0
  on the other hand great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds albert einstein  anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new albert einstein t c  so brave it is fascinating  this comment clearly comes from an established editor  i must say i find it disappointing to know that there is at least one editor on wikipedia who is so cowardly they cannot bring themselves to be linked to their comments  what are they afraid of i wonder  one would think that as they are too embarrassed to be linked to this post  then it speaks far more about them  than about majorly  chat maybe the editor in question is cowardly because they are privy the most private of communications  and would like to continue to be  knowing majorly  he ll probably go sulk on his blog about this hey majorly  i have some obie trice for you to listen to  bye for now just sock it for a while  just take a step back for a while  either start a new account or use your sock for a while  it will all blow over soon enough  ,0

 hi again dear  yes i strongly support independence of south azerbaijan from iran  if green movement could change somethings  probably i would change my idea  but i dont want to be under islamic rejim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of azerbaijani people and about azerbaijanis are turks or not despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of turkish people  we all know that turks started to migrate here circa ad when saljuk turks of west branch oghuz started to come  but infact it is not important when they came here  the important thing is every one in azerbaijan feel themselves as azerbaijani  and not azeri which is an invented word by persians  turks and believe that they r turks and speak turkish lang  as same as turks of turkey  you can come here and ask yourself one by one  you will see  it is so irrarational to say to some one that no  you r not turk  you dont know who you are  i know  you r azeri and azeris are indoeuropean  pls dont tell us who we r  let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a turk w hate ver others like or not  about aran  as i know we didnt have eyalat aran in the qajar era  we had eyalat azarbaijan and both azerbaijan rep  and armenia was part of this big eyalat as well as south azerbaijan  aran was part of this big land  but the important thing is  the name of land is not important here as well  the important thing is the people who live in azerbaijan rep former aran as you called  are of my race and we r same nation  you may call there azerbaijan or aran but the important thing is here a nation live which called themselves azerbaijani turks you may call them w hate ver you want as well as their land  the important thing is what they call themselves  if they change the name of their republic  will you satisfy  what about next  will you ask them to call themselves arani and start to speak aranian language  which does not exist  ok let s think azerbaijanis r not turk  so what they r  azeri  ok  let s call them azeri  what is the next step  you will ask them to forget to speak in turkish language and start to speak persian  or not  speak azeri lang so what is azeri lang where is it  can you learn it to about million people  let s thing pragmatic as well as rational  even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically  you cant ask them to speak neither a lang  of years ago nor persian also i dont rely neither to researches of kasravi nor zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments  one was paniranist other was panturkist  some of their researches looks really funny about the names of turkish places and cities  i guess you have never ever travell to azerbaijan  if you were here  you ll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era  some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us  for example tabriz has a suburb in western part of the city called akhma gay a which in turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place  do u know what is its official name ahmagiyyeh  the lands of stupid people  all of the turkish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally simmilar them  the fact is persian never have been to azerbaijan  most of the azerbaijani names have armenian or tat roots not persian  my believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like tats  armenians  and other caucasian tribes lived here and then turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called azerbaijani turks nowadays  they have their own culture  music  dance  cuisine etc  which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of turks of anatolia which believes that they r percent turk  i told you history is not important than today  the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a turk  i dont know what they want us to feel in tehran the name of azar abade gan looks wrong as well  this word cant change to azarbaijan during history  i guess the word was azar pay gan maybe  which zoroastrian persians called  not azar abad gan which ferdowsi mentioned in shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now i had a look to your files about vote frauding which i still believe is correct as well  the diagrams of those  pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election  but you know there is unwrittenable rules in iran which every one know  whenever some one come and ask me in person that do u like islamic republic  ali khameni and bla bla bla i will answer yes cos i dont want to lose my life  we dont have life guaranty,0
approximately the article is factually incorrect  etc on an don in the article are factually inaccurate statements about the confederate flag  esp as underlying all those statements are a fundamental and flawed understanding entirely of slavery in the us south  e g of white families in the us south never ever owned any slaves ever so imputing slavery as the basis for fighting in the civil war and so too the battle flag  the confederate flag  has that fundamental flawed distorted view add to that that northerners were almost the ship owners and ship captains that brought all slaves over to the us south and add to that that black kings  chiefs were the ones who sold into slavery  all the slaves that were in the us south  and so on and on the story is one of fundamental distortion and of the of whites in south who owned slaves  they have all been dead years  further add to the fact that for of white southerners  the flag has always represented valor in battle of the approximately white southerners who died in the war  add to that the war began due to invasion by north and the felt view of white southerners that states rights then was the main issue and to a very small view slavery way below that esp as those of confederate soldiers and their families did not own and had never owned slaves  to distort and warp all this factual history into black mania about the battle esp of valor  being a rascist symbol further massively distorted e g  by us media as cnn is simply put  mass hysteria with no almost no foundation in fact please add all this to revise the bottom of the article which has those endless wrong factual distortions  kareen abdulla selassie  imp of ethiopia sr ,0

 i think it is both a khmer character and a tamil character  then  the problem with it was not that the character was drawn wrongly  but that it did not represent the sound w like the other characters in the logo  the khmer character does not represent w either  talk according to wikipedia wikipedia logos alphabets represented in the logo  they do represent the letter from that alphabet that most closely resembles the english w as in wikipedia however  according to nohat at user talk nohat archive trouble in all the logos only some of the symbols were selected to represent wikipedia others were chosen at random  and threads at user talk nohat archive say the same thing  angela says the same thing in meta talk main page archives error in the wikipedia globe  zocky repeats it at talk main page archive wrong devnagari symbol for wi in wikipedia s logo  the only remaining tiny flaw i can see in your logo thue  is the top right piece  klingon r  is lacking any depth  there should be a black edge to the piece  but instead we see the grey of the inside not very important at all though  ah  i  and the person who reported the problem with the tamil khmer character  thought that all the characters should represent w but that is obviously not the case  imo the klingon r is within stylistic freedom  so i guess the logo is correct now  when at first you don t succeed  redefine success talk acousmatic hi there  you suggested a merger  but you did not start a discussion  i think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it  instead  i would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to  acousmatic sound  so that the page can function as a sub secion of  acousmatic music which is a particular form of electroacoustic music  one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources  the acousmatic sound article might focus more on schaefers  and chions  theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context  ,0
  some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults  some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult like fashion  according to some accounts  the third international operatives from various countries in the s were treated virtually as cult zombies by stalin s cynical bureaucrats arguably  himmler s ss included cultic formations trained at that castle  wewelsburg where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air  possibly this is a street legend as to north korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader cult religion  probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a stalin style personality cult since even stalin never strove for such a level of quasi religious worship and regimentation but i m not sure the term political cult is appropriate in reference to north korea  since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that don t wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secret police power of a post revolutionary state dking  dennis king sept ,0

  i m not immune to anything  if i commit a crime  i will be punished by both god and fate  no doubt  it is hard to say that you have no involvement when a large part of the an i discussion consisted of editors that disagree with my position on the events notability criteria having a bit of fun and a bit of sport  considering that you and i have engaged in that dispute  as is demonstrated by the link above  this block could be considered an act of vengeance on your part  i do have strong evidence that his views are embodied by what wikipedia is not  so are the views of many other editors  i do not doubt that they defy these principles in good faith  but good faith or not  our principles must be defended  or must they  i suppose we can simply ignore them  that doesn t seem right to me  but if you think it is what we should do  i guess we ve not much choice  ,0

 this article is being rewritten at jack abramoff abramoffrefactor  please take note of the existing notes and outline  and follow in the spirit of that rewrite refactor  comments welcome  thanks archives archive friday th august talk jack abramoff archive i made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with  copyvio this article and it s sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia they re essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia they need to be deleted immediately  alot of this article does seem to be a blatent copyvio tyco  as below  was edited  the text was accurate  but half the news story was pasted in here you cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story  attribute a link  and it not be a copywrite violation it s called plagerism  tyco  almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the wapo article i ve removed  part of it  as it needs to be re written  i think i ve cleaned much of the copyvio stuff up  hopefully there is alot of non essential stuff in this article about peripheral people  and not about abramoff  however it needs to be cleaned up more  as the article meanders alot here and there  i reverted some things you took out  outside the tyco section like in the early years section and in the intro about delay  that material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted  it still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it just providing a link is not attribution  and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism  not  fair use  unless you are quoting  also  if you are going to say  the los angeles times reports  you need to source the times  not a  secondary source  i e  democracy now i modified the quote and attributed properly  the speech from tom delay is a direct quote  it s in quotations  so of course it is taken word for word from the source  i ll tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request  here s the primary source for the other thing  no problem if i see something that is probable copyvio i tend to chop it out first  and then rework it  i don t usually just leave it out  if the quote is accurate btw have you found a link for the franken quote  i can t find anything other than on blogs honestly i m not sure what the relevence to an article on abramoff is  really  anyway  the forced abortions part was originally reported by brian ross at abc news for on march it also appears in al franken s book the truth  with jokes in the tom delay saipan sex tour and jack abramoff casino getaway chapter  since we ve agreed that primary sources are key  i ve change the attribution in the article  the indian tribes scandal this area is a mess  i have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better  it may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the reed  norquist etc pages to it basically we need fewer facts and more context  at the moment the page is simply a list of  trans actions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit  i moved the whole scandal to its own page  this makes much more sense since although abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players  in particular ralph reed  i am not doing this to hide the scandal  i think that people looking for info on i,0

shocked  i am a regular wikipedia user and despite having an eb account find myself using wikipedia increasingly as a source of generally impartial factual information  that opinion took a nosedive today when i came across this  article  in wikipedia while looking for information on ear protection  if i want to find out about bose headphones  or any other product  i will go to their web site i don t expect to find a companies product range specification in an encyclopedia  one can easily imagine the impact if every company starts using wikipedia as a site to promote their products under the guise of giving facts to the reader  the fact is i don t care whether this so called article is written from a npov or not  whether it s balanced or nor or even whether it is factually correct or not i do care that my favourite encyclopedia is being abused under the specious argument that if it s a fact it somehow deserves a place here  i can think of a hundreds of types of completely factual information that i don t want to see cluttering up wikipedia and marketing information is pretty close to the top of the list ,0

 do you follow the current scientific literature  please try not to sound so ridiculous when you are accusing others  it has a bad reflection on your own comments nevertheless  recent research indicates that self described race is a near perfect indicator of an individual s genetic profile  at least in the united states  using genetic markers  tang et al identified genetic clusters among individuals sampled from locations in the united states  and were able to correctly assign individuals to groups that correspond with their self described race  white  african american  east asian  or hispanic  for all but individuals  an error rate of they conclude that ancient ancestry  which correlates tightly with self described race and not current residence  is the major determinant of genetic structure in the u s  population  ,0

request to unblock i began writing the following statement  excepting its two postscripts  before i was  block i suspect that user  auburnpilot had me  block in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct  although i was directed to request an unblock of user  physicq who had  block  me  requesting such of the latter would require that i censor myself  and write as though user  physicq had acted in good faith  and was one of the good guys  that would be surreal  and would give user  physicq a moral legitimacy belied by his actions  and so  the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator but user  physicq but since i m not a devious sort  i have nothing against the latter reading this  indeed  i want user  physicq to read it  for if i can be banned from wikipedia for standing up to censors  then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting  than to go down the long dark road of self abnegation and self censorship  including the use of bad english  after all  if i wanted to be a lackey  i could go to graduate school wiki administrators notice board incidents http en wikipedia org wiki wikipedia administrators noticeboard incidents  user  auburnpilot  a few days ago  user  auburnpilot began stalking me  checking wherever i had made edits  and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them  he or she has been manipulating wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship  user  auburnpilot cannot even stand for wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes  zero tolerance he claims of any source he politically dislikes  that it is either spam or a blog or pov  another favorite dodge for those at wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own pov even though the one source is a previously published  classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the web  http geocities com nstix waronpolice html which the author has seen fit to publish on his web site  and the other source is the longest  most thorough expos yet published on the duke rape hoax  http vdare com stix duke htm note that i am not even talking about censoring writing within articles  since i hadn t done any writing on the articles in question  crystal gail mangum  michael nifong duke university lacrosse team scandal and racial profiling  i ve been involved in edit wars before  though i have never been the aggressor  and have never initiated an elective edit war  though given the self assurance that aggressors such as user  auburnpilot exude  perhaps i ought to reconsider that position  it seems that aggressors rule here the reason i am making a formal complaint is that user  auburnpilot has tonight upped the ante  threatening to have me banned  http en wikipedia org w index php title user talk redirect  no if i do not surrender to his censorship  should you find for me  please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease and desist order  should you  however  find for the censor  please provide an index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors p s  january a est  since beginning this complaint  i see that user  auburnpilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony  user  physicq to block me  thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me  but preventing me from responding to his thuggery and no  i am not going to use cutesy  euphemistic language  if i were into such deception  i would have become a liar  er  lawyer  and would be worthless as an encyclopedist and i was unable to e mail user  physicq because i am not logged in and you must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e mail address in your preferences to send e mail to other users  http en wikipedia org wiki special emailuser physicq if this isn t cyber stalinism  i don t know what is  so  let me get this straight  stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces  user  auburnpilot s penchant for saying thank you after vandalizing one s links  is civil  but complaining about such abuse counts as spam  disruption  incivility  and personal attacks  if that is verily so  then p p s the message here says that i was temporarily  block  from editing wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits  what the heck is that supposed to mean  for restoring footnotes and links that user  auburnpilot had vandalized  if that constitutes disruptive edits  then you ve utterly given up on honest english and all human decency  sorry  but i don t have any sympathy for the devil ,0

i think wikipedia does have an obligation of respect and we do self censor quite a bit  we can show self restraint and respect and yet show the community what they want to see such as photos of the garments  there are no nude or semi nude photos on other religious articles  why start here  if a photo needs to be shared  let it be current and without a live model  or at least a model with a face  why are they so ashamed to have their faces in the photos ebay and flickr more have up to date photos  not these from the s or s  this is completely offensive to the bulk of lds readers on wikipedia protecting the page is not the answer to keeping an image on it  rather lets find something that the community can agree on  and this current version it not it  and undoubtedly  as cogden stated end up with continuous vandalism of the page ,0

 with over college students studying abroad every year  there s bound to be all kinds of tall tales  urban legends  and misinformation swirling around while there may be grains of truth in some of these stories  below are some common misconceptions about study abroad misconception studying abroad is very expensive truth  in most cases  it is actually cheaper to study abroad let s say the tuition at your school is per semester and room and board is another now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance  books  and laundry you are now well over for the semester well  all but one of our programs in spain is under per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money  tab  misconception i can t use my financial aid to study abroad truth  in almost all cases  your federal aid  stafford loans  pell grants  etc can be used to study abroad and in some states  you can use your state aid as well it is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not  trans fer misconception host families are all poor and just do it for the money truth  the last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program the goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had if we were putting students in bad families  in dangerous neighborhoods  then no one would ever recommend us to their friends since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year  it s a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families  misconception i ll be so busy with schoolwork that i won t get time to see the country i m in truth  this one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about photos from a long list of countries students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in misconception i might not graduate on time if i go abroad truth  if you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses  then it s true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad if you plan ahead  however  and leave some electives open to you  then you should be fine the clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years  despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two misconception most of the world  hate s americans  so i won t be safe truth  there s no doubt that there are a lot of people who don t like the american government  but that has nothing to do with the american people if you compare the violent crime rate in the united states to that of european  australian  or asian countries  you will see that the united states is actually far more dangerous there are some areas of south america and africa that are not especially safe  but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe go to the u s  state department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is studying abroad is a once in a lifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard  speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts i guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you  you ll be hopping the first flight abroad one organization that help ensure that you have safest  unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is academic studies abroad  here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries  study abroad spain  academic studies offers study abroad programs in barcelona  madrid  salamanca and sevilla study abroad england  academic studies offers study abroad programs in london study abroad italy academic studies offers study abroad programs in florence study abroad france  academic studies offer study abroad programs in aix en provence and avignon http w academicstu,0

i think there s little doubt that there is taking in both directions here  more than likely the world golf hall of fame used the wikipedia article as inspiration for their own text and then an editor came in and copied over a small amount of content from their website unless the earlier wikipedia article copied from another source  which they later also used she was inducted into the world golf hall of fame in and would presumably not have entered their literature prior to that point  but the other content from that passage has been evolving in our article since it was created in this evolved gradually and naturally into the form it was in when in august it was sources  probably circularly  to the wghof and the snippet of their text pasted in meanwhile not all  but some of the content from that edit needs to be cleaned up a bit to comply with wp copy paste  for now  i ll clumsily address it with quotation marks  talk ,0

 november utc  from the boston globe lieberman  a democrat who won reelection as an independent  also said he wants to be called an independent democrat a strong backer of the iraq war  lieberman was returned to office on election day with strong gop support  he ran as an independent after he lost the democratic primary in august to ned lamont he said yesterday on nbc s meet the press that he will begin his new term as a democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership  the senator is in line to become chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee i m going to caucus with the democrats both because it s good for my constituents in connecticut  because i retained my seniority  i become a committee chair  but also i want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security  foreign policy  and innovation and progress in domestic policy  lieberman said he said that because voters returned him to capitol hill as an independent  i am now an independent democrat  capital i  capital d  matter of fact  the secretary of the senate called my office and asked how do you want to be identified and that s it  independent democrat  the senator said with many senate democrats having campaigned or raised money for lamont  as the party s nominee  lieberman acknowledged that it might be a little awkward for him back in washington they played by the traditional partisan political playbook  and i can t say i enjoyed it  but we re all grown ups  we ve got a job to do  and i m going to do my best to get that job done  lieberman said democrats will hold a edge in the senate  so lieberman  the democratic nominee for vice president in could find himself courted by republicans he was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as democrats sought to enforce party discipline  particularly if the gop offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority i m not ruling it out  but i hope i don t get to that point  and  and i must say  and with all respect to the republicans who supported me in connecticut  nobody ever said we re doing this because we  we want you to switch over  he said i believe that the american people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation  because they re understandably angry that washington is dominated too much by partisan political games  and not enough by problem solving and patriotism  which means put the country and your state first  lieberman said in senator james jeffords  addition by hodgdon s secret garden d  of vermont abandoned the gop and aligned himself with the democrats  putting them in control of the evenly divided senate  the switch made him a hero among democrats and a traitor among republicans lieberman said senator harry byrd of virginia listed himself as an independent democrat in the late s  before that  the last senator to use the designation was in the mid th century  he said link ,0

yes  i agree wladimir is going to have to many fights to headline now  vitali has considered fighting huck after huck defends his cruiserweight title and he has also expressed rematching chisora  he wants to fight haye but haye wants to much money to make it happen  clearly he s trying to cash out  that might be it for his career  since other p p boxers have more sections  i don t see the issue with adding more for vitali  but we can decide that in the future after his next fight  for now  there is only the chisora fight  given the slap in the pre fight conference  spitting in wladimir s face before the fight and brawling with haye in the post conference  i think this is worthy of a headline  it s also one of the most defining fights of vitali s career  as he won it at an old age with only one arm ,0

 with all respect  i don t know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor  in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around i don t think this is the way to make people feel welcome on wikipedia chussid should not make personal attacks  but other editors should not revert his multiple changes with curt explanations in the edit history any normal person in chussid s position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks  which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed  indeed  and the  reasons  they give are totally outrageous  these same people do consider w truepeace org which also does not give any names or an address of the person s  behind it a  reliable source because it fits in their zionist thinking pattern  jaz does not  if you ever wanted to know what jew s who oppose zionism go through  you are having a nice view of it right now  incitement to riot is not an excuse for rioting  just because you re bothered about something does not give you the right to cross the boundaries of civility  a discussion can be heated and honest without being incivil  and that s what we require here  ,0

 the lead is misleading the xbox one is a home video game console developed by microsoft the very first line of the article states it s a home video game console however microsoft have promoted the device as an all in one multimedia device for the living room  that has the ability to play games and media  i think stating  in the lead that it s a home video game console and not a multimedia device is very misleading ,0

 i actually hadn t even seen the current equalization filter article when i spoke before  but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article equalization  audio  that you both have proposed  i could make the issue a little more complicated though  graphic equalizer  not yet written smiley face curve  parametric equalization  and british eq all have to do with what i ll call music equalization for lack of a better term this includes sections and of the current equalization filter  along with possible future articles tone controls  loudness control  combine with smiley face speaker equalization etc  oh  i m certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles  but could as well be topics in one article  except that a few of these already exist separately the article should mention that equalization is a misnomer  but has become the accepted term  since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someone s taste  not strictly to compensate for a channel s frequency response then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization  or some such term  which would include section of equalization filter  telecommunications lines riaa equalization  fm pre de emphasis as well as equalization of non audio channels  this is the orginal meaning of equalization such equalizers are generally non adjustable  by a user  at least  and  trans parent to the end user  so i call it a different subject  even when it is audio  anyway  i don t have much time to deal with this nor am i the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems though i d be very happy to review what is written and check for errors and missing issues  come to think of it  i don t have to ask for permission ,0
the edit you pointed out as a supposed example of pov pushing was not pov pushing at all i removed a reference to steve stockman running in the republican primary against john cornyn i removed it because there were two other references to stockman s primary challenge to cornyn already in the article also  in the next edit that i did i added a better reference for the primary run i was the editor that put the original reference to the primary challenge in the cornyn article in the first place see  if it bald faced lies like that one that you just wrote here that get in trouble you are a pov warrior in the first order you attempt to slander people that don t agree with your editingjust like you are attempting to do here to me you have zero evidence for allegationsjust made up  bald faced lies i am not in seattle and i am a sock of either of those people i am not a sock of anyone you edit in bad faith and the way that you have been treating me in an example of your bad faith editing i don t have anything to be concerned about in relation to your sock allegation i ve known that all along i said it before you did i did not need you to tell me your apologies are out right lies also because when you apologize you come up with five or six more allegations against whomever you are apologizing to all of your apologies are fraudulent  just like your sock allegations please just stop responding to me because you re fake apologies just embarrass you further and make you look worst  stop it  go away ,0

 the article is mostly about the pound in general  with no mass force distinction  due its historical treatment as a weight  perhaps the numerous incarnations of the pound should be in a generic pound article  and pound  mass  should be in a similar category to any other unit of mass in a specific system  in this case the pound  mass  is a member of the fps gravitational system of units  there should be a link to the pound  mass  article from the pound article of course  but it deserves no better treatment than the lb  of the fps engineering system there is a table of the fps systems at pound force and at slug  mass  which tabulates various fps systems  it s a little less clear than it used to be  what was simply called fps engineering is now engineering  absolute and the fps gravitational system of units is apparently clambering for some credibility by calling itself the engineering  gravitational system which of course has no use in engineering due to its offence to newton s  nd law  where did the gravitational system come from  maybe some reliable sources are in order  ,0

 edits by keraunos  hi  keraunos  i see you added to  and rearranged  some of this article  i ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy  below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them you added the edit because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer  i take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource  but actually  that isn t physically accurate  the universal heat diverging to infinity doesn t provide usable energy  where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear  i e the universe s taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle  called mixmaster oscillations which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained  hence  i went ahead and cut this edit of yours if people read further into the body of the article  under the section outline of the physics of the omega point theory  some of this is already explained  with references provided for further research  with a number of the references available online for free you added a bit into here the omega point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infinite duration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace  which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature  i kept the ressurection link  i understand from reading your user page that you re into science fiction and  trans humanism  but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and  trans humanist terminology  as well as computer terminology which isn t that accurate  such as avatar the term preceding your edits  simulated reality  already expresses the ideas you re getting at  and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they re not sure what that means  you added most of this engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion  which  according to tipler  will occur  between x and x years from now  in proper time one should be more accurate in their terminology  as most people think of artificial intelligence  ai  as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs  yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality  then the programs of their minds would be natural  but on an artificial substrate  hence  i m changing this to from that point on  the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these  mind children  as it approaches the point of maximum expansion  with mind children referring to the previously defined mention of the term i also removed your quote of tipler s estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed  as that is from his book the physics of immortality  yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the hubble shift more accurately  which is what that estimation is based on  so tipler s current estimation is different now  for more on that  see f  j  tipler  the structure of the world from pure numbers  reports on progress in physics  vol no april pp see also here  also released as feynman weinberg quantum gravity and the extended standard model as a theory of everything  arxiv april you added the section criticism from string theory  i kept pretty much all of this  while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting  i changed the section title to implications from string theory  since brian greene doesn t actually offer any criticism of  or even refer to  tipler s omega point theory in greene s book that you referenced this section  as it stands now  might have to go entirely  as it appears to fall under wikipedia s rule concerning original research  as it s written  it s a valid deduction that the omega point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true  but it s an original deduction  you moved the see also section to underneath the references  you also added a number of links therein based upon wikipedia s featured articles  it appears that the preferred location of the see also section is where it was previously  before the references  hence  i moved it back  i removed the link metaverse  because it s a science fiction term that s perfectly explainable with more acce,0

 the less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is british irish isles believe when i say that the manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the u k  as a protected and supported territory  republic of ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the u k did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the british isles  place names reflect current realities  thus we have istanbul and not constantinople  a better example would be the aegean coast of turkey and its islands  this whole area was once referred to as the greek coast and all the islands were greek islands  since the political landscape has changed and the turkish state has jurisdiction  the only islands which are now greek islands are those within the jurisdiction of greece  if you were to rebut by saying that british refers to something more than a political term  but rather than an ethnic or geographical one  then the same argument  or even a better one can be made of greek the greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient greece  e g  southern italy  sicily  turkey  armenia etc  and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated greek are ethnically and linguistically greek but live in the state of turkey  and therefore the islands and coast are turkish  thus  you could not refer to the island of ireland as british  ,0

title of article in english wikipedia this morning  a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full vietnamese diacritics i just moved it back to the version without diacritics  for the following reasons this is the english language article about ngo  and the great majority of english text written about ngo  and other vietnamese generally  do not include diacritics in english  in fact  inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect  at best  or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard english orthography  please note i am by no means an english language bigot  i am a student of the vietnamese language  and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in vietnamese however  it is clear that in english  the diacritics play no role in pronunciation  the wikipedia guidelines on naming conventions asserts that the most commonly used spelling in english is the form that should be used apr utc ,0

 for the record  larson was working on a battlestar pegasus movie for about months when it became apparent that universal wasn t going to go anywhere with the galactica franchise  it turned out that larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on universal s part to do anything with commander cain and the pegasus  and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the atlantis  which was built by the th tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to earth  the film would have dealt with the search  a major battle with the cylons  and the recovery and use of the maps to reach earth  all w o involving the galactica or the rtf other than being mentioned the first article google shows is this one and the wikipedia set up for bsg had this one although i m not sure about whether there s some wikirule about referencing other mini wikis  the john larocque article on the attempt is at hollywood north report has a short blurb about the larson effort  but seeing as how their site has a  lot  of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware  i ll quote it here to save your systems in the spring of it was announced that glen larson was making plans to bring galactica to the silver screen impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film wing commander  larson paired with its producer  todd moyer  on an estimated million film that was to shoot later that year in luxembourg  the story picked up where the series left off  but followed the exploits of commander cain and the battlestar pegasus  made famous in the original series episode  the living legend  guest starring the late lloyd bridges in the concept  commander cain s search for the lost battlestar galactica leads him to contemporary earth  which  according to the story  was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar  atlantis special effects were to be handled by moyer s company  no prisoners  dfx  utilizing several of the artists who worked on wing commander moyer planned to update some of galactic ass hips  including giving the vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers  la the  trans formers when on planet surfaces moreover  he and larson planned to expand the galactica franchise to include an imax film  a theme ride  and a new line of merchandise then  as quickly as it had been announced  the project vanished from the radar screen it has been suggested that larson and moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues it has also been suggested that the film rights to battlestar galactica were still in some dispute in either case  the project disappeared into the ethers  iirc  cylon org had a page on this at one time  but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared  ,0

  moncrief  do you even know what a shepherd is  i used to work on a cattle ranch  so i know a bit about this stuff  to quote the wikipedia article on shepherds  a shepherd is one who takes care of sheep  usually in flocks in the fields  unlike farmers  shepherds were often wage earners  being paid to watch the sheep of others  the s weren t biblical times  shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down and out laborers got when they could get it  in fact  that s an important part of proulx s story  characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth  calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance i am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer  afterwards ennis worked with cattle and jack worked most of his life in an office job  not as a rodeo cowboy to whoever made that remark however  the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer  the summer that so defined them  therefore  i d say that the relevant description  especially in this paragraph discussing that summer  would be shepherds  that  however  is more up for debate  i would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep  although anybody who s ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that s just a circumlocution for shepherd  but since i don t want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page  i ll settle for that as a compromise  chris ,0
 wp film coordinator hey  i saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for wp film concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more  i m a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities  is it largely updating reviewing articles  and aiding in the establishment of task forces  at least as far as i can see do coordinators generally specialize in various areas  i e  one handles task forces  others reviewing  or a combination of any such duties if so  i was wondering whether i could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists  i rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all wikipedians  and i have a very good grasp of what is required for fl status  if i was elected  i probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under wp film s scope  and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to fl status with a coordinated effort  that said  i understand that i m relatively new to the film project  and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project  just curious as to your thoughts on the matter  cheers  converse ,0

 the importance of khalifman and of anand  ponomariov  kazimzhinov and topalov in being world champions during a time of crisis for fide cannot be overstated  they represent the rule of law  the functioning of the world title cycle  at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property  rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle  as it had been from onward to say that fischer  kasparov or alekhine were greater players and therefore of more importance overlooks this important aspect of khalifman s title reign  one could say that fischer  kasparov and alkehine were stronger than euwe and smyslov  too but that doesn t get us anywhere  we don t rank us presidents by reputation  we list them all equally  yes khalifman himself  in in interviews  said that although he was not the strongest player in the world  being th by rating  he was clearly the world champion  having won the title in the open  public cycle run by fide that stand  that position  is what makes his title reign important btw before anyone denigrates the fide title champions  it should be noted that at least two could be considered super gms  anand and topalov and that one  anand  regained the title via the classical method chesspride ,0

 ekantik  do you believe that sathya sai baba can miraculously  trans form his genitals  i would appreciate an answer i also find it amusing that ekantik  of all people  is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by sai devotees when ekantik is a hare krishna congregational member and a gaudiya vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that lord krishna literally manifested seperate human forms  married seperate women  copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring  sanjay also believes that lord krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for days and nights and defends scriptures that say the lord vishnu  a male trans formed himself into a woman  mohini devi so it appears that ekantik and sai devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned  i can t help to wonder why ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself funny how ekantik and andries  critics of sathya sai baba  want to promote well sourced stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference  written by a doctor in a well known sri lankan newspaper  is not well sourced this whole thing is pov and the attempt to skew the article with a pov is evidenced by these discussions  good luck wikisunn  you see what you are up against talk email ,0

list of ice hockey teams in ontario i updated template ohl and template defunct ohl to try to simplify things  template ohl contains all teams past and current for the ohl  template defunct ohl contains all past teams from the omjhl and the oha junior a  that template may need to be renamed  regarding the article list of ice hockey teams in ontario  how should we handle the defunct teams from the ohl  omjhl  and oha junior a that is a really good question i would like to add them  as it would allow the list to be both complete  and consistant with the others i havent added defunct jr a teams on any other article  but many of these oha jr a teams were the highest level of junior hockey at the time  i believe  so should be added as being equivalent of major junior however  that will likely make this a really long list it might make sense to split the article into two  active and defunct  as i did with the baseball lists  i would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets  then deciding from there if we hope to get it to featured list status  as i would like for all  then we can t use the template as a part of the article itself ,0

departments or states i am confused are the departments of honduras defined geographically  like the states of mexico  or the lands of germany  or even the states in the united states when can one department of honduras exercise authority over another department of honduras does the constitution of honduras subscribe to any theory of jurisdiction when it comes to organizing its departments  and is the jurisdiction of one department explicitly limited by a specific border or boundary with another if an individual  or his property  is taken into custody in one department  is there a hearing before a magistrate  as one would expect in a civil code country  before he  or the thing he has an interest in  is extradited to another department i think the main article could be improved by explaining when one department can exercise jurisdiction over an individual or corporation doing business in the area of a particular department  and when it is supposed to refrain from exercising that authority ,0

 delete example  would it be appropriate to delete the example section at the bottom mar utc  i think so  don t see what it adds mar utc  yes  moreover  it is not an example of random variable  its just a realization of random variable  hardly misleading mar utc i thought this was very useful because it showed an example where the map was not the identity map  i propose putting it back  false statement  a continuous random variable does not always have a density  preceding unsigned comment added by definition i dont like the definition here  not that i m letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting  but could this be considered a clearer definition random variable  the outcome of an experiment need not be a number  for example  the outcome when a coin is tossed can be  heads  or  tails however  we often want to represent outcomes as numbers  a random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment  the value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated there are two types of random variable discrete and continuous a random variable has either an associated probability distribution  discrete random variable  or probability density function  continuous random variable i think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r v  s which are neither discrete nor continuous  for example take the sum of one r v  of each type the current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader  the above definition is far better on both counts and so i will put it on the page  btw  sorry about the no summary edit  i hit the enter key accidentally  examples a coin is tossed ten times  the random variable x is the number of tails that are noted  x can only take the values so x is a discrete random variable a light bulb is burned until it burns out  the random variable y is its lifetime in hours  y can take any positive real value  so y is a continuous random variable  i think the above definition  for the original reference  pls search via google  explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value  rather like a numeric index to a database record  this would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms  the earler wikiedia definition led me to comment on another wikipedia definition incorrectly because i think i may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this wikipedia definition a random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event  this example just assigns another event to an event  could we change it to something like consider a game where if a is rolled on a fair six sided die  player wins  and otherwise  player wins  let x represent the number of times player wins  then  and  or maybe include an example of a continuous random variable  what do you think this section should begin with a sentence of the form a random variable is to avoid this is to show that you don ,0

blp stuff i m sorry i got annoyed with you  it is a bit tiresome having to deal with some of this stuff  and you probably didn t deserve the full brunt of my frustration there  still  please be sensitive to this in the future  i have  in fact  been dealing with people harassing me over this  and thus when i see you complaining about it over on ani  i just see it as more of the same  it isn t much fun  which is why i try to do this stuff only every other day or so with any great amount of focus  spending the rest of my free time writing about ponies kissing or playing video games or working on my own game or doing other stuff  the only reason i m even still involved with all of this is because i have a much higher tolerance than most people for doing stupid stuff like counting sources or fact checking or w hate ver  because i have a high tolerance for abuse because i have an enormous ego  and because i feel that it is important to keep wikipedia neutral about all things  even stupid internet fights i m sorry for missing your question over on gamergate about my edit  i noted my response to you in the ani thing  which is now closed but if you d like to discuss it further  i d be happy to do so ,0

  well i might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to wp dbad  here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit as i consider you had pointed me but that still hasn t given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page  here i mean the talk international recognition of kosovo page as far as the wp rm  if this is what you had in mind  is concerned  my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure  i m still not sure that there is one moreover  i m certain that for the time being he doesn t think of another pov of the procedure because of this words of his  which are somehow unclear  at least to me any new proposals will be speedy closed  persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the wp arbmac probation this article is under the scope of  concerning the closure of proposal i m not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of international recognition of kosovo irok or through the wp rm  actually  i find wp rm somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request proposal is to be made  i ve tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at wp rm  but then i might misunderstood something  i might consider asking for explanation on the very own project s page  as for that matter  hus  as a formalist as i consider you at the moment  i must ask you now this  when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through  in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through in order to have any validity  i suppose i pointed out one might consider i ve used irony  i apologize to those  to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure  since the very procedure hasn t been tagged as a guideline  but still named a project  to the least  maybe  some other place exists  which i m not aware of i apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner  since i ve been passive and not searching for potential one myself  not to mention judgemental and still non constructive enough  to contribute myself  although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action sorry for that  ijanderson you asked  why are you not claiming that this article has a pov title  international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia  well  actually  i do consider this title is biased also  but personally i consider the irok more globally important  not just to me  as one might think it is  if the bias is dealt with this issue  irok title it could be dealt elsewhere also  and imho it is good to keep the discussion in one place maybe creating a new page  where this discussion concerning the term recognition or more  could be taken  should be considered as an idea  all the best s talk  ,0

  september utc i love how i specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here  and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission your line response was the equivalent of nana nana boo boo  as far as i am concerned  let s dissect these lines  you don t understand propaganda  that is a loaded statement if i ever read one  i have read up on the term propaganda  thanks very much  and my readings are not simply limited to this website  which i feel is narrow in its scope  i have been on a program that toured the death camps of poland and studied the use of propaganda in  nazi  germany  i am currently awaiting a response from a phd who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media industry  and it is with respect to our point of contention here  funny  i can t find any work you have done on this subject  mr  jensen  yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here  i have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue  and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment  you use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful  i am not denouncing advertising for products i consider harmful  and this is what you need to understand  because i have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways  this statement you have just made is a personal attack  additionally  it is incorrect  i don t consider the product to be harmful  it is harmful  this is not an opinion  but a restating of facts by the iarc who  and health organizations worldwide  based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available  if it were simply an opinion  i can understand why you could be frustrated  but the irony  mr  jensen  is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture  tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer  among other health risks  please take the time  i urge you  to read any or all of the references i quoted in my submission  all from established medical journals the industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant  says that uv exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed  not proven whatsoever and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven  e g  cancer prevention  base tan exaggerated  and can be achieved through safer means  e g  vitamin d exposure so please enlighten me  mr jensen  as to what propaganda is  is propaganda not a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument that s the definition on the wiki page  right  i am sure you have head of a systematic review that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure  and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis  it is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure  well  that s what i use  and that s what the world health organization used  when they came to an unbiased conclusion that uv exposure from tanning beds  as well as the sun  is a carcinogen  in the same class as cigarettes  in my submission  i think i clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view  but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points  including the systematic reviews i mention  is this not the same as presenting one side of an argument to influence the attitude of the community or  is it that  as you say  i just don t understand propaganda i have to say it yet again to you  because i think this is such an important point that i have to drive home this is not my opinion tanning beds cause more harm than good  fact tanning industry sites present the good  which is partly true  and negate the bad  partly false and this is also a fact  if you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view  you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of good business its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product  and the result is advertising that is propaganda the industry has used scapegoats diversion tactics  e g  suggesting that cancer society and neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering  stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children  blaming o,0

  i don t want to reopen the issue  as the issue was never actually solved  wikipedia policies are pretty clear on what consititutes a valid source for any topic  and children s books and books not about the specific topic but that happen to mention it as an aside based upon no real knowledge of the topic clearly do not count  instead of just blind reverting changes  i d like someone to try to come up with some sort of justification within wikipedia policies that would make including such weak and nonacademic references as sources  whenever a source is in question  it should be up to the person who wants them to stay to provide reasons  not to just keep them come hell or high water because of some people s bias against editors who aren t signed in  these changes were badly needed  and seemingly the only reason they were undone was by one editor who thinks he wp owns the article and others who violated wp agf and assumed that an anon user must be up to no good  ,0

i think we need to write to debretts  david williamson is now dead  to ask if they actually had sight of the letters patent otherwise i would find it hard to accept their assertion  it would effectively mean that his eldest daughter had a fundamental right to call herself and be referred to in all legal documents as baroness or lady home of berwick  but in fact there is not one document notably her testament that i can find that refers to them as such  merely as his daughters with the honorific  lady  because they were daughters of an earl  in addition  debretts cannot settle these issues  did alec douglas home make a claim in the house for that peerage to be added to his stable  because that seems to be what they re saying  frankly i would treat such a suggestion with disbelief ,0

i strongly agree with lneal to keep those national statistics out because of completely varying methods used by different stat agencies in different countries  the numbers must come from one organization  claiming a b c is synthesis and is a direct violation of wp or  however  i agree with ahecht that there s no problem with the ilo list  it s from the bbc and the ilo list should be in because the numbers are coming from one highly reliable organization  if not the most reliable one  so we are comparing apples to apples  even if there are some flaws in that method  that flaw  as ahecht suggested  should be mentioned in the methodology  but blanking out such a highly reliable source because of that is unacceptable and a serious violation of wp npov  we can t favor one source over the another ,0

 basic income dispute resolution i don t understand the finding futile or how to proceed to resolve the issue  regarding the  wikipedia  bicycles  and wagons  reference  its my understanding that i am building a bicycle  that may be slightly off spec  and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell  instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec i point out also that the  basic income  is listed as a priority by four wikigroups  and so it is a pretty important bicycle also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage  and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct  and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability  imo  but regardless of this opinion  a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed to keep the bicycles wagons analogy  the page was a high quality bicycle  and an important bicycle to wikigroups there is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs  but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away  ,0

 page is in rough shape with the recent purge of content  the page is not as informative as it once was the biggest problem is the first section which had the proposed benefits of basic income topic removed one editor may appear to  hate  naturalfinance net  since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links  but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content for instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work  and the link to reciprocity is not online  and the topic not a major issue both of those topics have good quality blog classifiable sources available in order to be bold  i would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content  including from sources that are not government funded basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda  and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article  and prejudices suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening barring this broadened content eligibility  we all need guidance for what is eligible content  and perhaps what makes naturalfinance net ineligible  the content there was written in and has been adopted  whether independently or without attribution  by other authors here is the major recent deletion https en wikipedia org w index php title basic income diff oldid specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced some of these can be sourced elsewhere  but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted proposed benefits  naturalfinance net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don t spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients  or find and punish abusers basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions  such as social security in the us  is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened  reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation  and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction viewed this way  the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen  even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically  with less requirement on charity and welfare it is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner natural finance s definition of social dividends  variable basic income  tax revenue surplus over social program expenses  essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic  productivity  and automation growth  the affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy  ,0

  no  we don t the name ivory coast contains only english alphabet letters  and it would sort just fine in almost all cases where c  te d ivoire remains missorted  often appearing after croatia  after cyprus  after czech republic you can see this by looking at category communications by country and seeing where the subcategory category communications in c  te d ivoire is missorted  even though the sorting of the article of the same name has been fixed can you see the difference in order or you can see it by looking at category nations at the summer olympics and seeing where the article c  te d ivoire at the summer olympics is missorted  there are hundreds of those problems out there why don t you make yourself useful  and go fix some of them ,0

 utc an interesting comment convict leasing isn t the same as slavery where there s ownership and title  however  i would agree that we could amend the lead to read effectively abolished slavery  true there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour  one ended w  the th amendment  and the other was legalised under the th amendment  not the corwin amendment of in other words  what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in california  oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the involuntary servitude clause  wwhat do you think they were referring to futhermore  i don t see a problem including this in the article  so long as it is a small reference  and not the focus of the article  as to scholarship  there is reputable work on this  and there is no doubt that starting in the prison chain gangs were leased to private business  plantations  mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges  yes they were mostly black  the mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned  virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w  forced labour is slavery  though not chattel  this was systematic and went on until ww though today s version is slightly different  now  some of you asked for refrences and rightly so  slavery by another name by douglas blackmon  who is a respected writer journalist and received the pulitzer prize for this book which is on this very topic  that s the point  this is far from original research  and there are other scholars who ve written about it  now i haven t edited the article nor will i unless there is some agreement w  others editors here  but i d like to know the issue as it is now  how do other editors feel one other thing  american historians do not always agree on things  and i have noticed at least one conspicious neo confederate argument in the article  unsourced though on a different part of the article  so yes it s important to look at historians  but on some topics there s a whole lot of rubbish  particularly w  slavery issues  so a consensus by historians may never happen  and sadly ideological agendas do exist  and i understand what you blokes mean about good sources  i d say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important july ,0
 the use of the word goal was merely an approximation i hoped would help the explanation  it s not currently used in the article  to explain this a different way  if you construct a scale with anything but a geometric sequence  e g  an arithmetic sequence  the steps would not be perceived to be the same  if the perception of intervals was arithmetic instead of geometric  our equal tempered scales would be arithmetic sequences instead ,0
false accusation of off wiki harassment you ve crossed a line by making an absolutely baseless  unfounded and patently false accusation  i expect a retraction and demand an apology  i have never called any wiki editor  the editor who claimed to have received harassing telephone calls should take the matter up with appropriate law enforcement authorities  i m sure they will deal with them appropriately  but  they weren t from me ,0

centrifugal force acroterion  recently you took an interest in the centrifugal force page  i would be most grateful if you could look at the recent deletion of my edit on the main page of that article  if you check it out  you will find that wolfkeeper has a long record of deleting things which i put on the main article when i put that edit on yesterday  i was fully expecting wolfkeeper to delete it  but i was very careful to make sure that the edit contained only basic textbook material and that there could be no possible grounds to justify him deleting it you will recall that my block last week was because i was accused of incivility by having accused wolfkeeper of wikistalking for having deleted stuff that had put on the main page interestingly  wolfkeeper has attempted to justify his actions this time  his first reason was pathetic  it was something to do with the section being out of place  the second reason merely exposes wolfkeeper s total lack of knowledge about the topic in question the marble experiences a side on coriolis force as it rolls out to the edge of the turntable  interestingly  physusie who i presume was attempting to back up wolfkeeper has then come in and stated this very fact as if it were me that didn t know it if you are genuinely interested in justice on wikipedia and proving that there is no corruption  i would be most grateful if you could monitor the ensuing debate very carefully i know that you say that you are not trained in this topic but it is all very basic stuff and i am sure that you will be more than capable of seeing exacly what is going on ,0
  rewired i see you have updated the security system  nice  is it a mcafee just dropped by to relate a little story i uncovered as i wandered here and there  there once was a little boy named johnny who had a wonderful dog named laddie johnny was prone to emotional outbursts  and his mother was concerned by his overreactions  one day while johnny was at school  laddie was killed in an unfortunate accident  the mother took laddie s body and put it in the backyard  she was very worried how johnny would react to the news of his dog s death  when johnny returned from school  his mother said to him  i m really sorry  johnny  but laddie died in an accident  johnny responded okay and went upstairs to change his clothers  the mother was quite surprised at the calm reaction  after johnny put on his play clothes  he went out to the backyard  all of a sudden  the mother heard johnny screaming  she rushed out to the backyard and saw johnny prostrate over the dog s body and wailing  the mother said  but  johnny  i told you laddie died  in between sobs  johnny sputtered  i thought you said daddy  talk  ,0

way i see it  people who say the sherman is a very good tank  are seriously overestimating it  i mean come on  it was nicknamed ronson for a reason you know  any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good  the only notable good sherman at the end of the war is the vc firefly  but because us ordinance doubted the pounder could be fitted onto the tank  it was manufactured in limited quantities  the only notable features of the sherman was that it was produced in large quantities  had a mechanical reliability that beat the t and came with better secondary equipment such as fm radio and an elevation gyro stabiliser not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it  once  a sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a tiger tank  the tiger shot at the building  and the shell went right through and penetrated the sherman s turret  there are also tales of german tanks who take out two aligned shermans in one shot  also  do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull  those are efforts to help augment the armour of the sherman ,0

  ok  obi wan  you re starting to make me suspicious  what do you always ask exactly what i think are the right questions  own up  either way  you did not answer my question directly  and i also suspect you know it  does this mean that wpo is not useful to you but you did answer it indirectly  so you get an even more direct question in return  why make it obvious that you know a lot about wikipedia  without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise  for one  you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them  if you don t mind  i m going to take this straight to the source  wpo peeps  what the dealio  i ve asked people on wp to put up or shut up  i ve asked the wmf to walk their talk  in fact  i ve staked my rep several times now  and i m not done yet  now i m asking you  why don t you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better  on wiki or off obi wan certainly isn t the first to question your self righteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than wikipedia  i  for one  have been wondering for a while now  so  let s see what you can do besides making snarky  personal comments  here s a pot  and here s a kettle  need i mention what color they are  onwards with obi wan s points  i don t believe in nasty people  deciding anyone is bad  nasty  etc  has only one purpose  one can feel better about being bad  nasty  etc  to people they ve so judged  i don t think this is particularly productive  in fact  imo it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides  or  more often  others have convinced them  that they themselves are bad people  we could talk about this more in another thread  but we ve got to get back on topic here  so you know that the wikipediocrats are smart  you have spent more time there than you re willing to admit directly  i immediately wonder if it s just in reading or in writing  too  they are indeed among the smartest in the wp community reasoning wise that i ve met so far  but emotionally less than average  how do you think many of these smart m er f ers ended up getting indef  block  or banned  a lot of them fell from grace  not because they weren t an asset to the community  but because they didn t seem to know when  or they were completely unwilling  to stop fighting for what they saw as justice  that s one part of the answer  many of them are banned or  block whether rightly so or not  from editing on wikipedia  also  it s normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland  while still keeping a great emotional investment in it  you ll hear the same people spout their disdain for wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it  frankly  we could speculate about these people s motives and methods til the sun goes down  let s be more practical about what is best for wikipedia here  what we  as a wikipedia community  can t do is ignore them away  and  even if we could  we re doing a piss poor job of it  because i almost always hear about what s been said on wikipediocracy from a wikipedian before i go to the actual site  ultimately  i go back to my old standard  i don t give a  shit  where these people come from or what their motives are  all s i know is that they are saying something interesting  and i appreciate the fact that i don t have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as i read it  obi wan  no use playing coy  you know exactly what i m talking about  d ,0

 penis envy from wikipedia  the free encyclopedia jump to  navigation  search for the crass album  see penis envy  album for the virgin documentary  see  envy penis envy in freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psycho sex  development to the realization that she does not have a penis  freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and  sex  identity for women  according to freud  the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety in contemporary culture  the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis  or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals  contents  hide freud s theory o criticisms of freud s theory within psychoanalytic circles feminist criticisms male penis envy see also references external links edit  freud s theory  sigmund freud introduced the concept of a little girl s interest in and envy of the penis in his article on the  sex  theories of children  but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in when his work on narcissism was published  it was not mentioned in the first edition of freud s earlier three contributions to the theory of sex the term came to significance as freud gradually refined his views of female  sex ity  coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage  see psycho sex  development in freud s psycho sex  development theory  the phallic stage  approximately between the ages of and is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area  prior to this stage  the libido  broadly defined by freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind  focuses on other physiological areas  for instance  in the oral stage  in the first to months of life  libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat  sleep suck  and bite  the theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage  this becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psycho sex  development  these events known as the oedipus complex for boys and the electra complex for girls result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy for girls soon after the libidinal shift to the penis  the child develops her first  sex  impulses towards her mother the girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a hetero sex  relationship with her mother  since she does not have a penis she desires a penis  and the power that it represents  this is described as penis envy  she sees the solution as obtaining her father s penis she develops a  sex  desire for her father the girl blames her mother fuckeror her apparent castration  what she sees as punishment by the mother fuckeror being attracted to the father  assisting a shift in the focus of her  sex  impulses from her mother to her father sex  desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother the girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her  and thus replace her the child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment  by the principle of lex talionis the girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her  sex  desires from her father to men in general the offshoot of these events  often cited in the media and colloquially  is that a girl really wants to become her mother  so that she can control her father a similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development  the key differences being that the focus of  sex  impulses need not switch from mother to father  and that the fear of castration  castration anxiety  remains  the boy desires his mother  and identifies with his father  whom he sees as having the object of his  sex  impulses  furthermore  the boy s father  being the powerful aggressor of the family unit  is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his  sex  desires from his mother to women in general freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of  sex  identity  and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen,0

 the ezekiel passage is quoted in the moloch article in the encyclop  didia biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to yahweh  along with jeremiah both passages are also cited in the moloch aritlce in the catholic encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly  in my opinion but this position is to say the least improbable  the texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise  and the prophets expressly treat the cult of moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true god  it is cited in encyclop  dia britannica  moloch  with the comment note  also  the attitude of ezekiel in xx seq references which cannot be explained away  the article the international standard bible encyclopedia  molech  moloch  treats it rather strangely  remarking that this prophet regarded the practice as among the statutes that were not good  and ordinances wherein they should not live ezekiel given by god to his people  by way of deception and judicial punishment  as some hold  is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it  it is not clear what this means  quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding as some hold this article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to yahweh  it also brings in bogus moloch worship in connection to carthage  not a good article in any case three different rabbinical interpretations of the ezekiel passage appear at the interpretation by rashi accords with the most obvious meaning  disliked by trs  but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation  that would not be a reason to suppress rashi s interpretation and the writer does not do so there is a discussion at  which covers in part john day s treatment favorably but also discusses the ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people s belief  and apparently ezekiel s beliefs  that commands which ezekiel saw as bad came from yahweh  note  john day believes moloch is not yahweh  but that still does not answer the problems with that passage in short  the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by yahweh  it has long been in general a problem pasage  but those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it  it is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument  on could respond by citing the catholic encyclopedia response  which seems to me weak but add it with a citation if you will  but do not suppress the inclusion is not editorializing by me  i am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against  the ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to yahweh and normally used as support for that argument  indeed one of the main sources for that argument  my own pov  as much as i have one  is that the evidence is confused  there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions  and that one should present all sides though of course full discussion would be a book length article  your particular pov on a biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation  especially when it is normally cited in the moloch context by sources usually considered reputable  sometimes very much supporting the pov that the sacrifices were to yahweh  even when when that interpretation is rejected the ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion i don t believe that anything i have included in this article  including the ezekiel passage  is non standard for discussion of moloch  i have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood  one obviously cannot agree with all sides  moloch cannot easily be at once yahweh  an entirely different god  the name of a kind of sacrifice  passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony  but people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history it should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect  please let the normal statements used as arguments stand  regardless of the positions i am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound,0

  if one were to present arguments against it  the fact that it s taken shamelessly out of context is the stronger objection  i can t imagine that serious muslim exegetes would grasp at this ephemeral straw  i see ahmed deedat  zakir naik  etc  they re more prominent than rashid  but have no scholarly standing  anything better  if there s a serious history of this  we should include it  but we wouldn t use a statement from a television evangelist  even a very prominent one  to say  christians argue believe ,0
